# Maia-3 model + onnxruntime-web runtime (vendored)

These files are runtime data assets served verbatim from `public/maia/` (no Vite bundler
processing), mirroring the Stockfish `public/engine/` precedent. They are loaded client-side by a
dedicated Web Worker via `onnxruntime-web`; no server-side inference and no runtime third-party
fetch (reproducible builds, offline-capable).

## Model artifact — `maia3_simplified.onnx`

The Maia-3 ("Chessformer", Monroe et al.) inference model, committed **unmodified** (no
fine-tuning, quantization-in-place, or graph edits — AGPL §13 / MAIA-01).

`CSSLab/maia-platform-frontend` `src/contexts/MaiaEngineContext.tsx`). It is the smallest/"simplified"
deployment build of Maia-3, per D-09.

### License

The model is a CSSLab artifact ("Chessformer" / Maia-3) licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. FlawChess is
AGPL-3.0-relicensed (v1.32). Only the model **data asset** is vendored — **no CSSLab source code**
(encoding/inference utilities, `MaiaEngineContext`, etc.) is copied. See the phase attribution
requirement LIC-02 for the visible-surface citation of the CSSLab repo, AGPL text, model artifact,
and the Chessformer paper (arXiv 2605.19091).

## Runtime — WASM-CPU-only path: `ort.wasm.min.js` + `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.{mjs,wasm}`

The onnxruntime-web WASM (CPU) execution-provider runtime, vendored from the `onnxruntime-web`
npm package so the Worker can load it from a fixed path without bundler processing.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Package | `onnxruntime-web` v1.27.0 (MIT, Microsoft — github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) |
| Vendored files | `ort.wasm.min.js` (API bundle), `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs`, `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm` |
| Source | `node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist/` |

`ort.wasm.min.js` is the WASM-only minified API bundle (`ort.InferenceSession`/`ort.Tensor`/
`ort.env`), loaded via `importScripts()` in the classic Maia Worker. It requests the base
SIMD+threaded WASM build (`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.{mjs,wasm}`, ~13.5 MB) at session-create time.
FlawChess ships cross-origin isolation site-wide as of Phase 219 (D-05), so
`ort.env.wasm.numThreads` is chosen by `chooseWasmThreadCount()`
(`maia-worker.js`) — up to `MAIA_MAX_WASM_THREADS` (4) threads when
`self.crossOriginIsolated` is true, falling back to 1 thread otherwise. This
is the fallback path for browsers without WebGPU (D-09).

## Runtime — WebGPU-preferred path: `ort.webgpu.min.js` + `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.{mjs,wasm}`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Package | `onnxruntime-web` v1.27.0 (MIT, Microsoft) |
| Vendored files | `ort.webgpu.min.js` (API bundle), `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs`, `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm` |
| Source | `node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist/` |

`ort.webgpu.min.js` is the WebGPU+WASM API bundle. Feature-detected via
`navigator.gpu?.requestAdapter()` in `maia-worker.js`; when available, the Worker creates the
session with `executionProviders: ['webgpu']`, wrapped in a try/catch that falls back to the
WASM-only path above on ANY failure (no adapter, session-create failure, or an unsupported op —
RESEARCH.md Pitfall 4). `ort.env.wasm.numThreads` uses the SAME `chooseWasmThreadCount()` formula
on this path too, assigned before any session is created — WebGPU's own behavior (execution
provider, warmup, respawn) is unaffected by Phase 219 (D-08).

**Filename correction vs. earlier research:** 151-MAIA-CONTRACT.md's "Runtime facts" section
(written before this worker was implemented) expected a **JSEP** build
(`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.{mjs,wasm}`) for the WebGPU path. Direct inspection of the vendored
v1.27.0 `ort.webgpu.min.js` bundle (`grep` for the literal filename it requests) shows it actually
requires the **Asyncify** build (`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.{mjs,wasm}`) instead — the JSEP
pair is used by other bundles (`ort.min.js`, `ort.all.min.js`), not this one. The asyncify pair is
vendored here; the JSEP pair was never added (unused by this worker's chosen bundle).

## Local patch: 1 GB wasm memory cap (quick 260906-p54)

**What:** in both `.mjs` loaders (`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs`,
`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs`) the single imported-shared-memory
literal's `maximum` went from 65536 pages (4 GiB) to 16384 pages (1 GiB). The
`.wasm` binaries and every other byte are untouched.

**Why:** WebKit lets one page hold only three large wasm memory reservations
before `new WebAssembly.Memory(...)` throws `RangeError: Out of memory`. The
Stockfish pool (2 workers on mobile) takes two of the three slots; on iOS 26
the Maia host tries a WebGPU worker first (reservation 3), then on
`webgpu-unavailable` respawns a wasm-pinned worker (reservation 4) while the
first is still dying. That 4th reservation is FLAWCHESS-9V. Device RAM is
irrelevant here — six 1 GiB shared memories fit at once on a 6 GB phone; the
binding constraint is address space, not RAM.

**Legality:** a lower `maximum` on an imported memory is legal as long as it
stays `<=` the module's declared max. `shared:false` is NOT legal (import
type mismatch), so the shared flag stays `!0`.

**Re-apply after EVERY re-vendor:** the documented `cp` command below
overwrites both loaders with stock 65536-page bytes. Re-apply with:

```bash
cd frontend
sed -i 's/maximum:65536/maximum:16384/' \
  public/maia/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs \
  public/maia/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs
```

**How to verify:** per file, occurrence counts of `maximum:16384` == 1 and
`maximum:65536` == 0:

```bash
grep -o 'maximum:16384' <file> | wc -l   # 1
grep -o 'maximum:65536' <file> | wc -l   # 0
```

(Plain `grep -c` counts matching LINES, which happens to equal the occurrence
count only because these files are minified onto one line.) Plus the vitest
gate `frontend/src/lib/engine/__tests__/ortRuntimeMemoryCap.test.ts`, which
fails CI if the patch is lost on a future re-vendor.

**Hash note:** the SHA-256 table above records the UPSTREAM v1.27.0 bytes,
which the two `.mjs` files below no longer match by design (post-patch):

| File | SHA-256 (post-patch) |
|------|---------|
| `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs` | `ef292a5650859ae45c19c4b579acecda5217bb5fa20bda57fed28ad7d6fc87bf` |
| `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs` | `8443997b013f348bffc37ffa0d09b75a4cdc4f23df732314cd8bc79e36799acf` |

**Residual risk:** the whole ORT heap (model weights plus activations) must
now fit in 1 GiB. Today's 45 MB Maia-3 at up to 4 threads is far inside it; a
materially larger model would need the cap raised (and this section updated).

## Runtime binary ownership (Phase 213-09, G-213-35 second half)

As of Phase 213-09 the two `ort-wasm-simd-threaded*.wasm` binaries above are no
longer fetched by onnxruntime-web itself inside `InferenceSession.create()`.
The MAIN THREAD (`frontend/src/lib/engine/ortRuntimeSource.ts`) now probes the
WebGPU adapter's `shader-f16` feature BEFORE any Worker exists, chooses
exactly ONE of the two builds, streams that build's `.wasm` bytes with a
progress-reporting reader, and hands the resulting buffer to the worker at
spawn (`maiaWorkerHost.ts`) via `ort.env.wasm.wasmBinary`. The two `.mjs`
loaders and the two API bundles (`ort.wasm.min.js`, `ort.webgpu.min.js`)
remain worker-loaded via `importScripts()` exactly as before — only the large
`.wasm` binary moved.

**Bundle-to-binary pairing (verified by grepping each vendored bundle for the
literal filename it requests, per this file's "Filename correction" note
above):**

| API bundle | `.wasm` filename it requests | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `ort.wasm.min.js` (WASM-CPU-only) | `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm` | 13,479,978 bytes |
| `ort.webgpu.min.js` (WebGPU-preferred) | `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm` | 24,254,953 bytes |

The `.wasm` filename is derived from the `.mjs` loader's own basename by the
Emscripten-style loader convention (same stem, `.mjs` -> `.wasm`); the
pairing table above is re-grepped from each `.mjs` filename an API bundle
actually requests (`ort.wasm.min.js` -> `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs`,
`ort.webgpu.min.js` -> `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs`) rather than
assumed to carry over between versions (D-01).

**Phase 219-01 re-vendor (2026-09-06): re-pinned `onnxruntime-web` back to
1.27.0.** 1.29.0's wasm build measured 1.5-2.3x slower single-threaded and
gained nothing from threads on the reference box (`219-MEASUREMENTS.md`).
The pairing above was re-grepped against the freshly re-installed 1.27.0
bundles and is UNCHANGED from the 1.29.0 pairing — only the byte sizes moved
back down to their 1.27.0 values (table above). The
`ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_VERSION` bump accompanying this re-vendor (3 -> 4, see
`engineAssetCache.ts`) is what invalidates the 1.29.0 bytes sitting in a
returning browser's CacheStorage. `scripts/bench_maia_ort_wasm.mjs` is the
timing gate a future re-vendor must run and paste into the phase/PR summary
before merging.

**1.29.0 re-vendor (Phase 217-02, 2026-09-05, since reverted above):**
`onnxruntime-web` moved 1.27.0 -> 1.29.0. The pairing above was re-verified
by grepping the freshly installed 1.29.0 bundles for the literal
`.wasm`/`.mjs` filename each requests — `ort.wasm.min.js` still greps to
exactly `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs` and `ort.webgpu.min.js` still greps to
exactly `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs`. Pairing was UNCHANGED at
1.29.0; only the byte sizes moved. The `ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_VERSION` bump
accompanying that re-vendor (1 -> 2) invalidated the old 1.27.0 bytes sitting
in a returning browser's CacheStorage at the time.

**Re-vendoring command used (run from `frontend/` after `npm install`):**

```bash
cp node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist/{ort.wasm.min.js,ort.webgpu.min.js,ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs,ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm,ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs,ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm} public/maia/
```

**SHA-256 of the six vendored runtime files at v1.27.0** (same discipline as
the model artifact table above; reproduce with `sha256sum frontend/public/maia/<file>`):

| File | SHA-256 | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| `ort.wasm.min.js` | `ea3a767b15df7dbe3d695ec9c182ca0f15b2ce7750156c6b70276e11c28997f0` | 50,139 bytes |
| `ort.webgpu.min.js` | `a3f348c2fec54c8c4ac503967c33c1943a79e96dba40fb867ab0f501be94bf84` | 67,237 bytes |

Each hash was cross-checked against `sha256sum` of the corresponding file
under `frontend/node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist/` at the moment of vendoring
(identical) — the copy command above was run once, from `node_modules/` only,
never from a download or CDN.

**Empirical `wasmBinary` suppression gate (213-09-PLAN.md Task 1 — verified
headlessly in Node, not by reading docs):** both vendored `.mjs` loaders
(`ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs` and `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs`) were
copied into an isolated directory alongside the real vendored `.wasm` files,
driven directly under plain `node` with `fs.readFileSync` instrumented to
record every path read. Result for BOTH builds:

- **Without `wasmBinary` set:** exactly ONE read of the real `.wasm` file
  (baseline — confirms the loader does fetch/read the runtime binary when not
  given one).
- **With `wasmBinary` set to the real bytes:** ZERO reads of the `.wasm` file
  for either build.

This matches the source-level mechanism directly: both `.mjs` files assign
`Module.wasmBinary` into a closure variable (`q` in the wasm-only build, `sa`
in the asyncify build) the moment the factory runs, and BOTH the sync
binary-getter (`if(!q) ... await ha(a)`) and the streaming-instantiate path
(`if(!q && !isDataUri && !isNode) fetch(...)`) gate their read/fetch behind
that same variable being falsy. Setting `wasmBinary` therefore suppresses the
runtime binary fetch identically on the wasm-only AND the asyncify build —
there is no divergence between the two builds that would require keeping the
WebGPU path on `wasmPaths` resolution.

The `.mjs` loader itself (24-47 KB) is still resolved by onnxruntime-web via
`ort.env.wasm.wasmPaths` inside the worker — expected and negligible, not a
defect this change needs to prevent.

**1.29.0 re-check (2026-09-05, Phase 217-02):** re-ran the same headless
method against the freshly re-vendored 1.29.0 `.mjs` loaders and `.wasm`
binaries, copied into an isolated scratchpad directory (not committed —
same throwaway-script precedent as 213-09). One fix was needed vs. the
original script: the loader's factory is async and performs its actual wasm
read in a later microtask, so the `fs.readFileSync` instrumentation must stay
installed until the factory's returned promise settles, not just for the
duration of the synchronous call — reverting it immediately produced a false
zero-read baseline on the first attempt (caught by the "a zero-read baseline
is inconclusive, not a pass" rule). Result for BOTH 1.29.0 builds, matching
the 1.27.0 baseline above exactly:

- **Without `wasmBinary` set:** exactly ONE read of the real `.wasm` file (4
  runs total: 2 builds x with/without).
- **With `wasmBinary` set to the real bytes:** ZERO reads of the `.wasm` file
  for either build.

The `wasmBinary` handoff still suppresses the runtime's own `.wasm` read on
both 1.29.0 loaders — the Phase 213-09 byte-ownership contract holds across
this version bump.

## Engine-asset CacheStorage layer (Phase 213-12, D-20)

As of Phase 213-12 all three engine assets — this model, the ORT runtime
binaries above, and the Stockfish `.wasm` (`public/engine/`) — resolve
through ONE byte-ownership layer backed by the browser's Cache API
(`frontend/src/lib/engine/engineAssetCache.ts`). The main thread reaches it
via `getEngineAsset()`; this worker (`maia-worker.js`, which cannot `import`
a TS module) reaches the SAME versioned cache by name, passed to it in the
`init` message's `assetCacheName` field rather than duplicated as a literal.

**Because none of these files are content-hashed, the cache-name version
constant IS the invalidation path.** Replacing any of the three engine asset
files (this model, either `ort-wasm-simd-threaded*.wasm` binary, or the
Stockfish `.wasm`) without bumping `ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_VERSION` in
`engineAssetCache.ts` would leave every visiting browser reading the STALE
bytes out of CacheStorage indefinitely — worse than the HTTP cache below,
which self-heals after its 30-day `max-age`.

**Quick 260905-rhc: that one constant now invalidates all THREE cache
layers at once, not just CacheStorage.** `ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_VERSION` also
feeds `ENGINE_ASSET_VERSION_QUERY` / `versionedEngineAssetUrl()`
(`engineAssetCache.ts`), which every runtime-fetched `/maia/*` and
`/engine/*` URL is built through — including this worker's own asset
fetches, via `versionedAssetUrl()` and the init message's
`assetVersionQuery` field, since a classic Worker cannot `import` that TS
constant. A CDN edge (Cloudflare) and the browser's HTTP cache both key a
cached response on the FULL URL including its query string, so bumping the
version makes every URL the app requests one no cache layer has ever seen —
a stale entry at any of the three layers becomes structurally unservable,
not just eventually swept. **Bump `ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_VERSION` in the same
commit as replacing any of these files.** The next page load's cache-open
sweep also deletes every differently-versioned `flawchess-engine-assets-*`
CacheStorage entry automatically.

## Cache headers

`deploy/Caddyfile` caches this directory's binaries (the `.onnx` model, `ort.wasm.min.js`,
`ort.webgpu.min.js`, and the `ort-wasm-simd-threaded*` `.mjs`/`.wasm` pairs) at
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000` (30 days) — long enough that a returning mobile
visitor never re-downloads the 43.6 MB model on a slow link, short enough that bumping
`onnxruntime-web` here is picked up within 30 days even if the version bump below were
somehow missed. This is deliberately NOT `immutable`: even though every URL is now
version-pinned by a `?v=<n>` query (quick 260905-rhc — `ort.env.wasm.wasmPaths` in
`maia-worker.js` is the OBJECT form, `{ mjs, wasm }`, of full versioned URLs per backend, not
the bare string prefix this note used to describe), the 30-day policy is retained
deliberately rather than switched to `immutable`; a version bump is the invalidation path
either way, and the shorter policy is a second line of defense that costs nothing on the
happy path.

`maia-worker.js` itself is the one exception: it is `Cache-Control: no-cache`, not 30-day
cached, because it is OUR source (not vendored) and its message protocol changes alongside
the content-hashed app bundle on every deploy — caching it long would let a fresh
`useMaiaEngine`/`maiaQueue` on a new deploy talk to a stale worker that has never heard of a
newer protocol message. See `deploy/Caddyfile`'s `@maiaworker`/`@vendored_runtime` matchers
for the exact rule (quick 260729-sod, FIX 4).

## PWA precache

`vite.config.ts` `workbox.globIgnores` excludes both `**/*.onnx` and `**/*.wasm` so neither the
model nor the ort runtime is Workbox-precached (they are served/cached via the HTTP cache instead;
the model alone would blow past the iOS Cache API ~50 MB limit). `optimizeDeps.exclude` includes
`onnxruntime-web` so esbuild never relocates its runtime and breaks the fixed asset path.

`globIgnores` also excludes `maia/**` and `engine/**` in full (quick 260905-rhc): every asset
under these two directories is now requested through a `?v=<n>` query, and Workbox's precache
route only strips `utm_*`/`fbclid` when matching a request against the manifest — it never
matches a versioned request against an entry keyed on the bare path. Precaching the remaining
`*.js`/`*.mjs` glue/loader files under their unversioned URLs would therefore add install cost
for entries nothing can ever request again.

## iOS/iPadOS: wasm backend only (SEED-158, 2026-09-07)

Measured on the reference iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 26.6.1): every WebGPU shape (this 1.27.0 build and a
temporarily vendored 1.23.0 build alike) is killed by WebKit seconds after `ready`; the CPU wasm backend
survives full `/analysis` sessions on BOTH versions, at one and at two wasm threads. iOS therefore spawns
`backend: 'wasm'` directly (`maiaWorkerHost.ts` `spawnOnIosWebKit()`), never probes WebGPU, never
requests the asyncify pair, and leaves the thread count to `chooseWasmThreadCount()` (2 on a 4-core
iPhone). The 1.23.0 vendoring was removed the same day; the version was not the lever.
