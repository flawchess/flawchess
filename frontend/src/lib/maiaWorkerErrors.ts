/**
 * maiaWorkerErrors — shared, bounded Sentry classification for Maia Worker
 * failures (quick 260729-sod, FIX 2).
 *
 * Both `useMaiaEngine.ts` and `maiaQueue.ts` used to do
 * `new Error(\`Maia queue worker error: ${msg.message}\`)` — embedding the raw
 * worker text directly into the error message. That is exactly the CLAUDE.md
 * anti-pattern ("never embed variables in error messages — it fragments
 * Sentry grouping"): every distinct worker string (an OOM, a network `Load
 * failed`, an arbitrary ONNX runtime error) became its own Sentry issue
 * instead of grouping under one of a small number of stable buckets.
 *
 * This module classifies the raw text into one of three stable
 * `MaiaFailureKind` values, reports a message that does NOT vary with the
 * worker text (stable Sentry grouping), and moves the raw text into
 * `contexts.maia` where it stays inspectable without fragmenting the group.
 * A `maia_failure` tag makes every Maia failure filterable in one place,
 * regardless of which of the two call sites reported it.
