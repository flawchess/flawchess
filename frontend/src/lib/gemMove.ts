/**
 * gemMove — pure, worker-free "gem move" detection (Phase 163, SEED-092).
 *
 * A gem is a played move that is BOTH hard for a human to find (C1: the Maia
 * policy probability at the rating-matched rung is at or below
 * GEM_MAIA_MAX_PROB) AND the only good move in the position (C2: it is the
 * graded best AND beats the runner-up by at least MISTAKE_DROP in expected
 * score). Reuses the project's canonical sigmoid (`evalToExpectedScore`) and
 * generated threshold (`MISTAKE_DROP`) verbatim — this module never re-derives
 * either (Phase 162's single-source-of-truth discipline).
 *
 * No opening-ply guard (D-02), no "still losing" exclusion (D-01): a
 * best-try in a lost position still qualifies as a gem as long as it clears
 * both C1 and C2. classifyGem has no color/ply parameter, so it applies
 * identically to both movers (D-04) and at any ply.

/** Maia policy-probability ceiling for C1 (D-07) — strict-side v1 constant.
 *  Deliberately a flat cutoff, not an ELO-scaled iso-rarity curve (D-08 defers
 *  that refinement to a future phase — this constant stays independent of
 *  any per-ELO reference-probability curve).
 *
 *  Raised from 0.1 to 0.2 in Phase 172 (SEED-106 D-07): "hard to find" becomes
 *  "fewer than 1 in 5 rating-peers would play it." Measured against the Phase
 *  165 calibration TSV (`reports/data/gem-elo-calibration-2026-07-11T14-07-34-084Z.tsv`,
 *  3,000 positions x 6 rungs), the raise multiplies gem frequency by ~1.35x at
 *  Maia-600, rising to ~1.8x at 2200-2600 — and it NARROWS the 600-vs-2600 Elo
 *  skew from 3.8x to 2.9x (strong players were previously starved: only 2.9% of
 *  even the C2-qualifying positions cleared C1 at the 2600 rung). Caveat: the
 *  TSV's sample is enriched (21.8% of positions pass C2), so only the RATIOS
 *  above transfer to real games, not the absolute frequencies.
 *
 *  Cross-reference (Phase 175, SEED-108 D-01/D-03c): mirrors the backend's
 *  authoritative `GEM_MAIA_MAX_PROB` in `app/services/best_move_candidates.py`.
 *  This frontend copy is used ONLY by the live-engine fallback path
 *  (classifyGem/classifyGreat, below) — the stored/mainline path always reads
 *  the backend-classified `EvalPoint.best_move_tier` instead. If the backend
 *  constant is ever retuned, update this copy too. */
