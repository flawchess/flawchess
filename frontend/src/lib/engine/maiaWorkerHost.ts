/**
 * maiaWorkerHost — a single, refcounted Maia Web Worker shared by every
 * `/analysis` consumer (quick 260729-sod, FIX 3).
 *
 * Before this module, `/analysis` ran up to THREE independent Maia workers
 * simultaneously: `useMaiaEngine` (live chart), `useGemSweep` (background
 * sweep, via its own `useMaiaEngine` call), and `maiaQueue` (FlawChess
 * Engine's policy provider) — each holding its own ~226 MB ONNX Runtime WASM
 * heap. Desktop: up to 3 workers (~678 MB). Mobile/low-power (where the gem
 * sweep is gated off by `isLowPowerDevice()`): 2 workers (~452 MB — the
 * configuration that actually OOM'd mobile Safari on FLAWCHESS-92). See
 * 260729-sod-FINDINGS.md §4.
 *
 * This host collapses that to ONE Worker + ONE ONNX session, refcounted by
 * lease. The enabling simplification: the host serialises to exactly ONE
 * inference in flight on the wire at any time, so the worker's `result`
 * message is unambiguous without any request-id — ORT can't run two
 * inferences concurrently on one session anyway, so today's "parallel"
 * workers only ever bought parallelism by paying 3x the heap.
 *
 * The two existing consumer disciplines are NOT merged into this host — they
 * stay ABOVE it, driving it as plain leases:
 *  - `useMaiaEngine` keeps its `pendingFenRef` single-in-flight "drop and
 *    reissue" discipline (only the latest position matters for a live chart).
 *  - `maiaQueue` keeps its no-drop FIFO with per-request promises (every
 *    `policy()` call issued by `mctsSearch.ts` needs an answer — dropping one
 *    would leave an expansion's promise hanging forever) and its own
 *    same-FEN batching (deduped distinct ELOs, never the full ladder) BEFORE
 *    calling this host's `analyze()` once per batch.
 * Their caches, however, ARE now shared (Phase 194 CACHE-05): the UCI-keyed
 * `fen|elo` policy cache lives in `maiaPolicyCache.ts`, write-through
 * populated by `useMaiaEngine`'s chart on every ladder rung and read by
 * `maiaQueue`'s `policy()` on a hit — so a position the chart already
 * inferred serves the engine's own root policy call without a second Maia
 * forward pass. This host still owns transport only (worker spawn/respawn/
 * death, one in-flight request, priority ordering) and guarantees every
 * `analyze()` promise settles; it holds no cache of its own.
 *
 * Ownership of the Task-1/Task-2 respawn + Sentry-capture logic moves here
 * from `useMaiaEngine.ts`/`maiaQueue.ts`, which no longer construct a Worker
 * or handle `webgpu-unavailable`/`onerror` themselves.

 * BEFORE the Worker is constructed, so the worker's own former `'auto'` mode
 * (probe-inside-the-worker) no longer exists. `runtimeBuffer` is the
 * onnxruntime-web runtime `.wasm` bytes for `ort.env.wasm.wasmBinary` — absent
 * when the shared runtime fetch degraded to `null` (T-213-09-02), in which
 * case the worker leaves `wasmBinary` unset and onnxruntime-web resolves the
 * binary from `wasmPaths` exactly as before this change.
 *
 * Phase 213-12 (D-20, closing G-213-37): `assetCacheName` is set from
 * `ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_NAME` (imported, never duplicated as a literal — the
 * worker cannot `import` this TS module) on EVERY spawn in `constructWorker`,
 * covering both the `'auto'` and the `'wasm'` respawn branch with the one
 * assignment. It is the SAME versioned CacheStorage name `engineAssetCache.ts`
 * opens on the main thread, so `maia-worker.js`'s own small mirror of that
 * cache logic reaches the identical cache by name rather than a duplicated
 * literal — the mechanism that makes a second Maia worker spawn (the
 * per-game respawn `BotsGame`'s `key={boot.nonce}` remount guarantees) cost
 * zero network after the first complete download.
 *
 * Phase 213-12 (D-20): LOST `modelBuffer` — the `G-213-8` handoff (a dying
 * WebGPU worker transferring its downloaded model to its wasm replacement)
 * is retired. CacheStorage supersedes it: every replacement worker now reads
 * the model from the SAME versioned cache via `assetCacheName`, which costs
 * zero network whenever the model was already downloaded, without keeping a
 * second transferable in this message (the exact shape that produced
 * `G-213-36`).
 *
 * Quick 260905-rhc: `assetVersionQuery` is the shared `?v=<n>` suffix
 * (`ENGINE_ASSET_VERSION_QUERY`, derived from `ENGINE_ASSET_CACHE_VERSION`)
 * — set on EVERY spawn in `constructWorker`, the same object literal that
 * already sets `assetCacheName`, covering both the normal spawn and the
 * wasm-pinned respawn with one assignment. The worker cannot `import` this
 * TS module, so the suffix arrives on the message instead of being
 * duplicated there as a literal. Absent means unversioned URLs inside the
