/**
 * workerPoolState — the leaf module of the `workerPool.ts` split: the shared
 * mutable state (`PoolState`), the cross-stage call surface (`PoolOps`), the
 * tunable degradation knobs, the pool's own types (`QueuedGradeRequest`/
 * `PoolWorkerSlot`/`GradeCache`), and the pure priority-queue/pool-sizing/
 * predicate functions (`enqueue`/`dequeueHighestPriority`/`sideToMove`/
 * `isLowPowerDevice`/`computePoolSize`/`noLiveSlotRemains`) — Phase 215-02
 * (SC-1/SC-2), extracted from `createWorkerPool()`'s 596-655 state bindings;
 * consolidated here (215 code review WR-01) so the module graph is a real
 * DAG instead of a facade↔stage cycle (see below).
 *
 * This module imports NOTHING from `workerPool.ts` or the three stage
 * modules (`workerPoolWatchdog.ts`, `workerPoolDispatch.ts`,
 * `workerPoolLifecycle.ts`) — only `./types`. Every one of those four
 * modules imports FROM here instead: `workerPool.ts` re-exports this file's
 * constants/types/functions for its existing external importers (a plain
 * `export { ... } from './workerPoolState'`, not a redefinition), and each
 * stage module imports the constants/types it needs directly from here. That
 * makes the graph `workerPool.ts` -> `{watchdog,dispatch,lifecycle}.ts` ->
 * `workerPoolState.ts` — a DAG, not a cycle.
 *
 * WR-01 history: before this consolidation, `workerPoolState.ts` type-only
 * imported `PoolWorkerSlot`/`QueuedGradeRequest`/`GradeCache` FROM
 * `workerPool.ts`, while `workerPool.ts` (and every stage module) imported
 * runtime bindings (constants, `enqueue`/`dequeueHighestPriority`,
 * `sideToMove`, `computePoolSize`, `noLiveSlotRemains`) BACK from
 * `workerPool.ts` — a real facade<->stage import cycle that this file's own
 * header used to (incorrectly) deny, claiming the `PoolOps` dispatch table
 * was "what lets sibling modules call into each other without an import
 * cycle." That claim was true only for the STAGE<->STAGE calls the table
 * actually exists for (watchdog -> lifecycle's `replaceDeadSlot`, lifecycle's
 * `createSlot` -> dispatch's `handleLine`, dispatch -> watchdog's re-arm) —
 * it said nothing about the separate facade<->stage cycle in the constant/
 * type imports, which was runtime-safe only because every cross-module
 * binding was read inside a function body, never at module-evaluation time.
 * Moving the shared leaf definitions here (rather than adding a new
 * `workerPoolCore.ts`) keeps every stage module's existing `from
 * './workerPoolState'` import path unchanged for the `PoolState`/`PoolOps`
 * types they already imported.
 *
 * `PoolState` bundles the twelve mutable bindings `createWorkerPool()` used
 * to close over directly; each field below keeps its original Phase
 * 213/CR-01 doc comment verbatim, since that comment carries load-bearing
 * decision history (race-condition guards, respawn-generation invalidation,
 * readiness/failure settlement) rather than just a type description.
 *
 * `PoolOps` is a nine-field dispatch table, not a plain data object: every
 * field is a function one stage module may need to call into another
 * stage's implementation. It deliberately exceeds CLAUDE.md's "context
 * object with fewer than three fields and one reader" carve-out — it has
 * nine fields and a reader in every stage module — because the real call
 * graph between the stages is CYCLIC: the watchdog stage fires into the
 * lifecycle stage's `replaceDeadSlot`, the lifecycle stage's `createSlot`
 * wires the dispatch stage's `handleLine` as the worker's message handler,
 * and the dispatch stage re-arms the watchdog stage on every fresh
 * dispatch. Late binding through one shared table is what lets sibling
 * STAGE modules call into each other without an import cycle BETWEEN
 * THEMSELVES: `createWorkerPool` builds one `ops` object, wiring each field
 * to whichever module actually owns that stage's implementation. This does
 * not (and never did) apply to the separate facade<->stage constant/type
 * imports fixed above.
