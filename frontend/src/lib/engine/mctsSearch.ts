/**
 * mctsSearch — the primary `SearchRunner` orchestrator: select -> terminal
 * check -> expand -> backup -> snapshot (ENGINE-01/02/04/05/07).
 *
 * Composes the Plan 01-03 primitives (`leafScore.ts`, `backup.ts`,
 * `select.ts`) plus the shared tree helpers (`treeCommon.ts`, WR-06) into
 * the frozen `SearchRunner` contract from `guardrail.ts`.
 * Two correctness invariants are structural, not incidental, in this file:
 *
 *   - D-07 / ENGINE-04: every `providers.policy()` call's `elo`/`side` are
 *     derived from the CURRENT node's own fen side-to-move field
 *     (`fen.split(' ')[1]`), never from depth/ply parity.
 *   - Root-relative frame (153-01/153-RESEARCH.md Pattern 3): `rootMover` is
 *     computed exactly once via `sideToMoveFromFen(rootFen)` and threaded as
 *     a constant into every `leafExpectedScore()` call — never recomputed
 *     per node.
 *
 * D-09: one "node" = one expansion event (one `policy()` call + one batched
 * `grade()` call); `nodesEvaluated` increments once per expansion, never for
 * a terminal/depth-capped dead end (Pitfall 6 — those never call providers
 * at all). D-10: `onSnapshot` fires after EVERY completed backup; no
 * `Date.now()`/`performance.now()` anywhere in this file. D-03/D-04: root
 * children are Maia top-k unioned with `budget.extraRootMoves` (guaranteed
 * inclusion, AFTER truncation, so a near-zero-Maia-probability Stockfish
 * candidate is never dropped by the mass cut) and, at `concurrency > 1`,
 * multiple expansions are selected synchronously within one round (marking
 * each as `isPending` — the sole gate that keeps a later same-round
 * selection from re-picking it; visit counts increment only at APPLY time,
 * so intermediate `onSnapshot` counts never depend on how many expansions
 * were dispatched together) then dispatched together and applied to the
 * tree strictly in their canonical dispatch order via `Promise.all`'s
 * order-preserving resolution — never raw promise-arrival order (Pattern 5).
 *
 * Determinism scope (ENGINE-07/D-03): output is deterministic PER
 * concurrency level — repeated runs at the same `budget.concurrency` are
 * bit-identical regardless of provider resolution jitter. Different
 * concurrency levels may legitimately build DIFFERENT trees: at c=1 the
 * second selection of a round happens AFTER the first expansion is applied
 * (it sees the backed-up value and may re-descend the same subtree), while
 * at c>1 pending-exclusion forces same-round selections onto different
 * nodes. A c=1 vs c=2 output difference is therefore NOT a bug — do not
 * attempt to equalize the two levels.
