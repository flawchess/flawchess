/**
 * workerPoolLifecycle — the spawn/respawn/death stage of `workerPool.ts`'s
 * per-worker state machine: constructing a slot's `Worker` and wiring its
 * `progressPort`/`onmessage`/`onerror` handlers (`createSlot`), the
 * shared-URL construction loop that runs once per pool spawn
 * (`runSpawnConstructionLoop`, `ensureSpawned`), replacing a slot whose
 * worker has permanently failed so one fault costs a worker rather than a
 * slot for the rest of the page visit (`replaceDeadSlot`), and the three
 * public teardown/prewarm entry points (`stopAll`, `terminate`, `warm`)
 * (Phase 215-02 extraction from `createWorkerPool()`). Not a React hook —
 * plain module, no UI wiring, matching `maiaWorkerHost.ts`'s framing as
 * "the singleton that owns Worker spawn/respawn/death".
 *
 * Every function here takes the pool's shared `PoolState` and cross-stage
 * `PoolOps` dispatch table as its first two parameters (`workerPoolState.ts`)
 * — this stage reaches into the watchdog stage via `ops.clearSlotWatchdog`/
 * `ops.armInitWatchdog`, into the dispatch stage via `ops.handleLine`/
 * `ops.dispatchNext`, and into `createWorkerPool`'s own readiness functions
 * via `ops.markPoolFailed`. `markPoolReady`, `markPoolFailed` and
 * `whenReady` deliberately stay inside `createWorkerPool` itself (not this
 * module) — they own the `poolReadyWaiters`/`poolReadyRejecters` pair and
 * are the CR-01 readiness seam, and keeping them co-located with the
 * `WorkerPool` return literal keeps that contract readable in one place.
 * The pool's own types and constants (`MAX_SLOT_RESPAWNS`/`computePoolSize`/
 * `noLiveSlotRemains`) import from `workerPoolState.ts`, never from the
 * `workerPool.ts` facade (215 code review WR-01) — see that file's header
 * for why.

 * Replace a slot whose worker has permanently failed, so one fault costs a

 * `fireWatchdog`, `fireStopWatchdog` — AFTER each has settled the slot's
 * in-flight request and marked it `dead`.
 *
 * Replaces the three call sites' former `if (noLiveSlotRemains()) drainPending()`
 * and keeps that guarantee: pending requests are still drained when no live
 * slot is left, which now means the respawn failed or the budget is spent. A
 * successful respawn deliberately does NOT drain — the fresh worker will
 * service the queue once its `readyok` lands.
 *
 * Two details that are load-bearing rather than defensive:
 *  - The dead worker is TERMINATED, not just dropped. `fireWatchdog` fires on
 *    a wedged-but-alive worker, which would otherwise keep its Stockfish heap
 *    and whatever it is chewing on for the rest of the visit.
 *  - Its handlers are detached FIRST. A wedged worker can still emit a late
 *    line or error, and that must not reach a slot no longer in the pool —
 *    `handleLine` would flip `isReady` on an orphan, and a late `onerror`
 *    would spend respawn budget on a slot already replaced.
