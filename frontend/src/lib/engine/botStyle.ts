/**
 * botStyle — the pure, synchronous bot-style transform module (Phase 182,
 * STYLE-01/03/04/05). Holds the `BotStyleParams` raw-numeric-knob data type
 * (D-01: engine code consumes ONLY numbers — no style names, no player
 * derivation, BOT-03), the cheap chess.js move-feature classifier, and (in
 * later plan tasks landing in this same file) the three pure transforms
 * that hook `selectBotMove`'s existing seams: prior reweighting (STYLE-03,
 * Human rungs), score shaping (STYLE-04, Light/Deep rungs), and
 * opening-book weighting (STYLE-01, composed over `openingBook.ts`'s
 * `maiaPolicyWeighting`).
 *
 * DEVIATION from `openingBook.ts`'s "no chess.js import" purity convention:
 * this module DOES import `chess.js` — `classifyMoveFeatures` needs the
 * verbose `Move` object's `.san`/`.flags`/`.piece`/`.captured`/`.from`/`.to`
 * fields (checks, captures, pawn geometry) to derive per-move style
 * features. Every function here otherwise stays synchronous, has no I/O,
 * and touches no React/provider state — the same "pure engine module"
 * contract every sibling in this directory follows.
 *
 * Every knob on `BotStyleParams` is `[ASSUMED]`/hand-tuned per D-12 —
 * magnitudes are set by Plan 05's bundles, iterated against the
 * `scripts/style-lever-measurement.mjs` measurement script, not derived
 * analytically. This module only defines the SHAPE and the pure transforms;
 * it ships no named style bundle itself (that is Plan 05's
 * `botStyleBundles.ts`).
 *
 * Forward pointers — the exact call sites that will consume these exports:
 *   - `applyStylePriorReweighting`: `selectBotMove.ts`'s `blend<=0` branch,
 *     between `deps.policy()` and `botSampling.ts`'s `samplePolicy` (Plan 06).
 *   - `applyStyleScoreShaping`: `selectBotMove.ts`'s search branch, between
 *     `search()` and `argmaxLine`/`sampleRankedLines` (Plan 06).
 *   - `styleBookWeighting`: `useBotGame.ts`'s `resolveBookMove`, passed as
 *     `openingBook.ts`'s `selectBookMove` `weighting` argument (Plan 07).
 *   - `BotStyleParams`: `BotSettings.style?` (Plan 06) and
 *     `BotGameSettings.style?` (Plan 07) — always optional; `undefined`
 *     everywhere runs today's exact code path (D-03).

 * prefix (`[...moveHistorySan, candidate.san].join(' ')`) is a member of

 * `boostMultiplier`; every other candidate keeps its base weight unchanged.
 *
 * `moveHistorySan` is curried in at construction time (Pitfall 2,

 * joined prefix to disambiguate between lines that share an opening move.
 *

 * BEFORE this — or any — `weighting` function is ever invoked (Pitfall 1;

 * affect it: a boosted-but-implausible style line still leaves book exactly
 * as an unboosted one would.
