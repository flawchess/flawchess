/**
 * stockfishWorkerSource — the single owner of Stockfish Worker construction
 * (Phase 213-08, G-213-35).
 *
 * Bug fix: every Stockfish Worker used to load its own copy of the vendored
 * `.wasm` (`useStockfishEngine`, each `workerPool` slot, both grading hooks)
 * — between 5 and 8 independent 7,295,411-byte fetches per analysis-board
 * page load, all issued in the same tick so the HTTP cache could never dedupe
 * them (29-51 MB of duplicate transfer). This module fetches the `.wasm`
 * ONCE on the main thread via `engineAssetCache.ts`'s `getEngineAsset()` —
 * the same cache-first layer every engine asset now shares (Phase 213-12,
 * D-20) — publishes the bytes as an `application/wasm` Blob object URL, and
 * hands that URL to every Worker through the vendored glue's OWN
 * already-shipped wasm-path override: the worker script reads its `.wasm`
 * URL out of `self.location.hash` (`stockfish-18-lite-single.js` worker
 * entry — `u = decodeURIComponent(hash[0] || …)`) and `instantiateWasm`
 * streams from exactly that URL. The vendored file is not edited — this is
 * the glue's own supported override, not a patch.
 *
 * D-08: the shared fetch is triggered ONLY at the spawn seams that already
 * existed (`ensureSpawned()`, each hook's worker-lifecycle effect) — nothing
 * is fetched at import time and nothing is fetched speculatively. No timeout,
 * no `saveData`/`effectiveType`/`navigator.connection` read, no trigger of
 * its own — a wall-clock timeout on a 7.3 MB body would fire on exactly the
 * throttled connections this fix exists to help.
 *
 * T-213-07: a failed shared fetch must never be able to break engine spawn —
 * `ensureStockfishWorkerUrl()` NEVER rejects; every failure mode (network
 * rejection, non-ok response, absent `response.body`, absent
 * `URL.createObjectURL`/`Blob`) is caught, reported once to Sentry, and
 * resolves `null`. A `null` shared URL (quick 260905-rhc, D-05) still passes
 * `STOCKFISH_ENGINE_WASM_PATH` through the glue's location-hash override —
 * NOT the pre-fix "construct against the served path alone" behavior,
 * because the vendored glue's OWN fallback derives an unversioned `.wasm`
 * URL from `location.pathname` (which drops the query string), and that
 * would be the one unversioned runtime URL left in the system after this
 * fix. See `createStockfishWorker()`'s own doc comment.
 *
 * `ensureStockfishWorkerUrl()` stays memoised for the WHOLE page session
 * (unlike `ortRuntimeSource.ts`'s per-call `getEngineAsset()` routing) — the
 * published Blob object URL is a Worker-construction HANDLE, not a byte
 * cache, and `workerPool.ts`'s `replaceDeadSlot()` depends on getting the
 * SAME valid URL for the life of the page. This retention is deliberate and
 * is NOT the kind of in-memory byte patch D-20 retires.
