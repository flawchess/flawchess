/**
 * maiaPolicyCache — a module-scoped, LRU, `fen|elo`-keyed cache of UCI-keyed
 * Maia move-probability distributions, shared by two consumers (Phase 194
 * CACHE-05):
 *
 *  - `maiaQueue.ts`'s `policy()` provider (the engine's root-position Maia
 *    call, one rung per FEN via `budget.elo[leaf.side]`).
 *  - `useMaiaEngine.ts`'s write-through: the exact selected-ELO rung first
 *    (quick 260906-gu2 — the rung the engine's root call needs), then all 21
 *    `MAIA_ELO_LADDER` rungs per navigated position.
 *
 * Module-scoped by design: it outlives any single `createMaiaQueue()`
 * instance, so a position the chart already inferred stays available to the
 * engine across re-renders/re-mounts of the hook that produced it. The key
 * construction (`${fen}|${elo}`) is intentionally private to this module —
 * `elo` is a required, separate parameter on both accessors, so no caller can
 * build a FEN-only key that would silently serve one ELO rung's distribution
 * for another (T-194-07).

/**
 * `fen|elo` policy-cache cap. The engine's `policy()` call contributes at
 * most one entry per distinct FEN (side-to-move is fixed per FEN, and the
 * engine calls `providers.policy(leaf.fen, budget.elo[leaf.side], leaf.side)`
 * — one ELO per FEN) — bounded above by the same measured 386-FEN working
 * set a 400-node analysis search touches (194-RESEARCH.md Pattern 4). The
 * chart's write-through additionally contributes 21 entries (one per
 * `MAIA_ELO_LADDER` rung) per navigated position. 2048 - 386 leaves roughly
 * 79 navigated positions of chart history. At an estimated ~2 KB per entry (a
 * `Record<string, number>` over ~30-40 legal moves) the cap costs ~4 MB
 * against Maia's ~226 MB WASM heap (Phase 194 CACHE-01).

 * Before this, every navigation cost the engine a duplicate ~200 ms root
 * inference on wasm — the chart's request was already queued ahead of it on
 * the shared worker, but the engine's `policy()` checked the cache before
 * that result landed. `setCachedPolicy` settles the entry; a failed request

 * never miss because only one side of a comparison normalized.
 *
 * Maia's own encoding reads only fields 1-2 (`maiaEncoding.ts`'s
 * `encodeBoard` and `maia-worker.js`'s `encodeBoardTokens`), and chess.js
 * legal-move generation (which the mask/softmax step depends on, needing

 * root FEN for the same position, previously missed the cache/pending
 * registry purely on a counter mismatch.
