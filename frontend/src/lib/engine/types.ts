/**
 * types — the frozen public contract of the Phase 153 pure search core.
 *
 * These types are locked for the rest of the v2.0 FlawChess Engine milestone
 * (Phases 154-157 build against them unchanged). Every field cites the
 * decision that fixes its shape:
 *   - D-04: the root-only extra-move union with Maia top-k.
 *   - D-06: `practicalScore`/`RankedLine` are root-side-to-move expected
 *     score (0-1), never a per-node/per-ply-relative value.
 *   - D-07: ELO is color-keyed ({w, b}), never self/opponent-keyed.
 *   - D-08: the engine core speaks UCI everywhere (moves, policy keys,
 *     grade keys, paths) and side-to-move is the FEN 'w'/'b' literal.
 *   - D-09: one node = one expansion event (the unit `maxNodes` counts).
