/**
 * workerPoolWatchdog — the host-side fault-detection layer for
 * `workerPool.ts`'s per-slot UCI state machine (D-06, FLAWCHESS-9G, quick
 * 260731-s0z FIX-4): the grading watchdog (a `go` that never answers
 * `bestmove`), the stop-bestmove watchdog (a `stop` that never answers), and
 * the replacement-slot init watchdog (a respawned worker that never
 * completes its UCI handshake). Not a React hook — plain module, no UI
 * wiring, matching `maiaQueue.ts`'s "closure/module-level state, not a
 * hook" convention (Phase 215-02 extraction from `createWorkerPool()`).
 *
 * Every function here takes the pool's shared `PoolState` and cross-stage
 * `PoolOps` dispatch table as its first two parameters (`workerPoolState.ts`)
 * — most of these seven functions only need `slot` itself, but the uniform
 * signature is what lets `createWorkerPool()` wire every watchdog entry
 * point through one `ops` table without a per-function special case, and
 * `fireWatchdog` genuinely does need `state.slots`/`state.slotRespawns` for
 * its Sentry diagnostic context. Fault handling always ends the same way —
 * marking the slot `dead` and calling `ops.replaceDeadSlot(slot)` — which is
 * why `replaceDeadSlot` (owned by the lifecycle stage, not this module) is
 * only ever reached through `ops`, never imported directly. The pool's own
 * types and constants (the watchdog timeout/re-arm knobs) import from
 * `workerPoolState.ts`, never from the `workerPool.ts` facade (215 code
 * review WR-01) — see that file's header for why.
