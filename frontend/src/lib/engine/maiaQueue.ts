/**
 * maiaQueue — a Maia policy provider supplying per-node UCI-keyed
 * move-probability distributions for an explicit per-side ELO (POOL-03).
 *
 * This is the real implementation of the frozen `EngineProviders.policy()`
 * method (Phase 153), forking the already-shipped `useMaiaEngine.ts`
 * `{type:'analyze', fen, eloInputs}` protocol into a non-React async queue.
 * Not a React hook — plain module, no UI wiring (that lands in Phase 155).
 *
 * D-04: requests only the distinct ELOs the search needs (often just `{w,b}`
 * from `SearchBudget.elo`, deduped) — NEVER the full 600-2600 ELO ladder
 * `useMaiaEngine` sweeps for its chart. Cache is keyed by `(fen, elo)` — as of
 * Phase 194 CACHE-05, this cache is `maiaPolicyCache.ts`'s shared
 * module-scoped singleton, also write-through-populated by `useMaiaEngine`'s
 * chart, NOT a separate cache as before.
 *
 * Open Question 2 (154-RESEARCH.md): unlike `useMaiaEngine`'s single-in-flight
 * "drop and reissue" discipline (fine for a UI that only cares about the
 * LATEST position), every `policy()` call issued by `mctsSearch.ts` needs an
 * answer — dropping one would leave an expansion's promise hanging forever.
 * This module therefore uses a proper async FIFO queue: one ONNX inference in
 * flight at a time, every caller's promise resolves.
 *
 * Worker ownership (quick 260729-sod, FIX 3 — reverses Phase 154 D-04's
 * "SEPARATE Worker() instance" decision): this module no longer constructs
 * its own Worker. `/analysis` running up to THREE concurrent Maia workers —
 * this queue's own, `useMaiaEngine`'s chart worker, and `useGemSweep`'s own
 * `useMaiaEngine` instance — cost ~226 MB of WASM heap EACH: up to 3 on
 * desktop (~678 MB) and 2 on mobile/low-power (~452 MB, the configuration
 * that actually OOM'd mobile Safari on FLAWCHESS-92 — the gem sweep's
 * `isLowPowerDevice()` gate keeps its instance from spawning there). This
 * module now acquires a `priority: false` lease from the shared
 * `maiaWorkerHost` singleton instead, which owns Worker spawn/respawn/death
 * and guarantees every request settles. The D-04 part that still holds is
 * requesting only deduped per-side ELOs instead of the full ladder — the
 * previously-separate `(fen, elo)`-keyed cache is now the shared
 * `maiaPolicyCache.ts` singleton (Phase 194 CACHE-05, see above).
 *
 * Lazy lease acquisition on the first `policy()`/`warm()` call (D-02),
 * `type: 'error'`/`webgpu-unavailable`/worker-death Sentry reporting is now
 * entirely owned by `maiaWorkerHost.ts`; this module's own graceful-
 * degradation floor is the `.catch` in `processQueue` below — a lease
 * rejection (worker death) settles every affected promise instead of leaving
 * it hanging (Pitfall 1).
