/**
 * ortRuntimeSource — the single main-thread owner of the onnxruntime-web
 * runtime `.wasm` binary (Phase 213-09, G-213-35 second half).
 *
 * Bug fix: today onnxruntime-web fetches its own runtime binary INSIDE
 * `InferenceSession.create()`, resolved off `ort.env.wasm.wasmPaths` in the
 * worker — an object of versioned per-backend `.mjs`/`.wasm` URLs (quick
 * 260905-rhc; a bare string prefix cannot carry a `?v=` query — see
 * `maia-worker.js`'s file header). That fetch never touches a streaming
 * reader, posts no progress, and has no asset id — 14.0 MB (wasm-only) or
 * 25.7 MB (WebGPU/asyncify) transfers with the gate's bar showing nothing. Worse, on
 * a device whose WebGPU adapter lacks the `shader-f16` feature the worker
 * used to fetch the WebGPU build, fail its D-14 warmup `analyze()`, and THEN
 * fetch the wasm-only build too — 39.7 MB to end up exactly where a straight
 * wasm boot would have started (see 213-09-PLAN.md's objective).
 *
 * This module moves both decisions to the main thread, BEFORE any Worker is
 * constructed: it inspects the WebGPU adapter's advertised feature set to
 * choose exactly ONE build, then resolves that build's bytes through
 * `engineAssetCache.ts`'s `getEngineAsset()` — the same cache-first layer
 * every engine asset now shares (D-20) — reporting every chunk under the
 * `ort-runtime` asset id, and hands the resulting buffer to the worker at
 * spawn (`maiaWorkerHost`, Task 2) for `ort.env.wasm.wasmBinary`.
 * onnxruntime-web then issues NO runtime request of its own — see this
 * file's Task 1 gate finding below for the empirical proof that `wasmBinary`
 * actually suppresses that fetch.
 *
 * Empirical `wasmBinary` gate (213-09-PLAN.md Task 1, run headlessly in
 * Node against the real vendored `.mjs` loaders with `fs.readFileSync`
 * instrumented — see the vendored README's "Runtime binary ownership"
 * section for the full method and result): setting `wasmBinary` on the
 * Emscripten module factory suppresses the runtime `.wasm` file read/fetch
 * for BOTH builds. Baseline (no `wasmBinary`): exactly one `.wasm` read for
 * each build. With `wasmBinary` set to the real bytes: ZERO `.wasm` reads for
 * either build. The `.mjs` loader itself is still resolved by onnxruntime-web
 * via `wasmPaths` in the worker (24-47 KB) — expected and negligible, not a
 * defect this module needs to prevent.
 *
 * D-08: the fetch is triggered ONLY at the spawn seam that already exists
 * (`maiaWorkerHost.ts`'s `ensureSpawned()`/`spawn()`, Task 2) — nothing is
 * fetched at import time and nothing is fetched speculatively.
 *
 * A failed fetch (network error, non-ok response, absent body) must never be
 * able to break engine spawn: `ensureOrtRuntime()` NEVER rejects — every
 * failure mode resolves `{ backend, buffer: null }`, reported once to Sentry.
 * A `null` buffer makes the caller spawn the worker with `wasmBinary` simply
 * left unset, so onnxruntime-web resolves the binary from `wasmPaths` exactly
 * as it does today (T-213-09-02).

 *
 * Phase 213-12 (D-20, G-213-36 mechanism moved): before this fix, the
 * fetched `ArrayBuffer` was itself memoised inside this promise and handed
 * DIRECTLY to every caller. `maiaWorkerHost.ts`'s `constructWorker` pushes
 * that buffer into `postMessage`'s transfer list, which DETACHES it — so the

 * producing `DataCloneError: ArrayBuffer at index 0 is already detached`
 * inside a `.then()` as an unhandled rejection. 213-11 fixed this with a
 * retained, never-transferred master plus a per-call `slice(0)` copy — this
 * plan supersedes that mechanism: `getEngineAsset()`'s cache-first design
 * makes retain-and-copy unnecessary, because every call already resolves an
