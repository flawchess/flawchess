/**
 * workerPool — a pool of 2-4 single-threaded Stockfish.wasm Web Workers that
 * grade candidate moves via `searchmoves`-restricted MultiPV searches,
 * fronted by a plain-array priority queue (POOL-01, POOL-02). The queue's
 * ordering machinery is fully built and unit-tested, but every request
 * dispatched through the current frozen 2-arg `EngineProviders.grade(fen,
 * candidateUcis)` contract carries `priority: 0, depth: 0` (no caller exists
 * yet to supply real values) — so dispatch order is NOT currently "toward the
 * currently-highest-scoring root line first" in practice. Phase 155's MCTS
 * orchestrator is the intended real priority source (see the priority-queue
 * section below and 154-03-SUMMARY.md WR-02).
 *
 * This is the real implementation of the frozen `EngineProviders.grade()`
 * method (Phase 153), generalizing the already-shipped single-worker
 * `useStockfishGradingEngine.ts` state machine (Phase 151.1) into N
 * independent instances. Not a React hook — plain module, no UI wiring
 * (that lands in Phase 155).
 *
 * Load-bearing caveat (SC5, confirmed on the real binary — 151.1-01-SUMMARY.md):
 * every MultiPV-consuming path here keys results by `parsed.pv[0]` (the move),
 * NEVER by the `multipv` field — that field is an eval RANK that reorders as
 * search depth climbs, not a stable move identity.
 *
 * Phase 195 (LADDER-02/04/06): `grade()` takes an optional 4th `gradingDepth`
 * param (mirroring the Phase 194 `signal` precedent) resolved by the caller
 * from `gradingDepthForTreeDepth(leaf.depth)`; the `go` line is composed
 * exclusively through `buildGradeGoCommand` (D-08, one shared builder for the
 * app and the `.mjs` calibration harnesses) and carries no wall-clock bound —
 * the removed `GRADING_MOVETIME_SAFETY_CAP_MS` is replaced by the host-side
 * watchdog (D-06, `GRADING_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_MS`) added in this file below.
 *
 * The tunable degradation knobs, the pool's own types
 * (`QueuedGradeRequest`/`PoolWorkerSlot`/`GradeCache`), and the pure
 * priority-queue/pool-sizing/predicate functions (`enqueue`/
 * `dequeueHighestPriority`/`sideToMove`/`isLowPowerDevice`/`computePoolSize`/
 * `noLiveSlotRemains`) live in `workerPoolState.ts` (215 code review WR-01) —
 * this file re-exports every one of them below for its existing external
 * importers (`useGemSweep.ts`'s `isLowPowerDevice`, `useFlawChessEngine.ts`'s
 * `computePoolSize`, and this module's own test file), rather than
 * redefining them, so the module graph stays a DAG: this facade and the
 * three stage modules all import FROM `workerPoolState.ts`, never the other
 * way around.
