/**
 * Shared "only one good move vs several" guess vocabulary (190.1-03 D-03;
 * revocabularized Phase 222 D-09).
 *
 * Single source of truth for the exact wording so `TrainSolveScreen`'s guess
 * buttons and `TrainReveal`'s verdict row can never drift apart — extracted
 * to its own module (rather than exported from either component) to avoid a
 * parent/child circular import between the two (`TrainSolveScreen` renders
 * `TrainReveal`).
 *
 * D-09 (Phase 222): the short button-label form became "Only one" / "Several"
 * (`GUESS_LABELS`) — the old "One critical move" / "Several fine moves" pair
 * read as two full sentences stacked in a 375px button row. The reveal's
 * guess card header needs its own longer call-form ("Your call: only one
 * good move" / "Your call: several good moves") because the short label
 * alone is unreadable out of context there — `GUESS_CALL_LABELS` is a
 * SEPARATE map, not an overload of `GUESS_LABELS`. `guessFeedbackProse`'s six
 * sentences below are untouched LOCKED wording — they already spell out
 * "only one move works" / "several moves are fine" in full prose and do not
 * read `GUESS_LABELS` at all.

/**
 * Quick 260803-iv6 (Task 3): one prose sentence stating what the guess verdict
 * MEANS — the guess card states the verdict but never says WHY it landed
 * where it did. Belongs beside `GUESS_LABELS` (this module already owns the
 * guess vocabulary) rather than inline in `TrainReveal`.
 *
 * The six return strings are LOCKED wording — reproduced verbatim, never
 * reworded. Guard-clause returns, no nesting.
 *
 * Two bug fixes (2026-08-03) shaped the current branch set:
 *
 * 1. The correct-`critical` branch used to be a single "You identified the one
 *    critical move.", which reads as "you PLAYED the critical move" — badly
 *    misleading for the (common) guessed-right-played-wrong case, and directly
 *    contradicted by the Your-move box's own zero-point chip right above it.
 *    Hence `moveTier`: the praise clause is only earned by a `good` move.
 *    A sharp puzzle's runner-up is a mistake by construction (`SHARP_GAP_ES`
 *    aliases `MISTAKE_DROP`), so `good` there means the best move specifically.
 * 2. The correct-`several` non-herring branch said "You handled this fine in
 *    your game." — reachable ONLY on a `soft` puzzle, i.e. one of the user's
 *    OWN BLUNDERS (`pool_entry_stmt` filters `severity == blunder`; sharp-vs-
 *    soft only sub-classifies that set). It told users they had played well at
 *    the exact positions where they blundered, with the "Played in game" box
 *    showing the blunder directly above. Hence `fromOwnBlunder` — the old
 *    parameter name `fromPlayedGame` described the intent, not the predicate.
 * 3. Same omission as (2), one branch over: a MISSED `critical` guess on a soft
 *    puzzle said only "Several moves are fine here.", reading as "nothing
 *    happened here" at another of the user's own blunders. It now carries the
 *    same trailing clause, which is why the soft case is one shared sentence
 *    across both guesses — the position fact does not depend on what the user
 *    guessed about it. Only the herring case still splits on `correctGuess`,
 *    for the affirming "Indeed".
