/**
 * trainArrows — pure reveal-board overlay builder (arrows + square-corner
 * quality badges) for the Train solve screen (Phase 190.1, D-02; reworked per
 * 190.1 UAT).
 *
 * Color language (190.1 UAT, recolored per Phase 200 D-04/D-05): BLUE always
 * marks the engine's best move (the app-wide "engine pointer" hue), the
 * user's PLAYED move is colored by its own move quality (good/inaccuracy/
 * mistake/blunder), alternative fine moves — the SERVER's vetted "Also
 * fine" list as of Phase 211 (D-01), no longer the client engine's MultiPV
 * ranks — are dark green regardless of whether the server classified them
 * best, good or inaccuracy (a 'best'-quality alternative keeps its blue
 * best-star BADGE, though — the deep engine's endorsement is real
 * information), and the thin white on-top arrow still marks the move
 * played in the original game.
 * Every arrow additionally gets the matching move-quality badge (the shared
 * SquareMarker corner glyphs) on its target square.
 *
 * Quick 261008-opg reverses Phase 200 D-04/D-05, which drew a played
 * inaccuracy as good so the board would not contradict a verdict that called
 * it correct. Since tiered scoring (SEED-119) an inaccuracy earns 1 move point,
 * not 2, and the verdict says "decent move [+1]", so the green collapse itself
 * became the contradiction. Only the server-vetted "Also fine" alternatives
 * still render inaccuracy as good: they are listed as acceptable moves.
 *
 * Extracted into its own module (rather than inlined in TrainSolveScreen) so
 * the puzzle-type-aware arrow selection is unit-testable without rendering a
 * board, and so TrainSolveScreen's own logic stays small.
