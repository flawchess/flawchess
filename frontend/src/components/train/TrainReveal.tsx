/**
 * TrainReveal — the auto-opening post-solve reveal panel (SOLV-05/06/07-
 * adjacent, D-07..D-12 from Phase 190, D-01..D-05 from Phase 190.1).
 *
 * Auto-opens as soon as grading and the solve POST have BOTH landed — no
 * "show solution" tap (D-07). Order (190.1 UAT round 3, regrouped in Phase 200
 * UAT round 6): the guess-feedback card (verdict + score chip in its header,
 * outcome copy (D-11) and the Also fine move list in its body), mastered hint
 * (D-12, countdown removed), up to
 * three steppable engine-line boxes (190.1-03 D-03; the move verdict is the
 * Your-move box's header mark, in canonical your > best > game order — UAT
 * round 5 reversed round 3's best-leads-on-a-miss rule), then
 * the compact game footer (SOLV-05). The opt-in tactic stepper (SOLV-06) was
 * REMOVED per 190.1 UAT round 4 — confusing, not needed. The Solution/
 * Analyze/Next row lives below the board in TrainSolveScreen.
 *
 * 190.1-03: every line box's eval/PV comes from the client grading engine
 * (`GradeResult.bestLine`/`.playedLine` from `gradeMove`, and the reveal-time
 * "played in game" search from 190.1-01) — never a stored server line/eval
 * (D-01). A previous plan's stored best line (`PuzzleRevealResponse.pv`) is
 * no longer read here.
 *
 * T-190-16 (Information Disclosure — speculative prefetch): both
 * answer-adjacent fetches this component owns (the reveal GET and the game
 * card) are gated on the solve response being present (`verdict !== null`) —
 * neither ever fires before the solve POST has actually succeeded.
 *
 * When the solve POST has NOT succeeded (still pending, or failed), this
 * component renders only the pre-existing block-and-retry row (190-04) —
 * same test ids, same disabled-Next contract — so 190-04's own regression
 * coverage (`TrainSolveScreen.test.tsx`) keeps passing unchanged.

          absorbed what used to be three loose surfaces: the guess verdict row,
          the outcome sentence, and the standalone "Also fine" card.

          Header: the green legend glyph (only when alternatives were actually
          drawn), the guess verdict, and its score chip — scored from the
          server-computed `correct_guess`, never a client-side re-derivation.
          The MOVE score lives on the Your-move box's own header chip.
          Body: the Also fine move list, and nothing else. Phase 200 UAT round
          7 retired the last outcome sentence (the herring "You handled this
          well in the game" line), as round 3 had already retired the miss
          sentence — the verdict rows and line boxes say everything, so the
          card is header-only when there are no alternatives to list.

          Because it swallowed the Also fine row, this card is now that row's
          legend entry too and carries its spotlight contract verbatim: the
          same `train-reveal-also-fine` key, all of its UCIs spotlit together
          (D-02 — no per-token granularity), desktop hover / mobile whole-card
          tap. Handlers attach ONLY when the list is actually shown, so an
          alternatives-free card never spotlights an empty move set (which
          would filter every arrow off the board).

          Hidden in free play (both viewports), alongside the line boxes below:
          the board is showing the user's own exploration by then, not the
          puzzle, so neither the Also fine legend nor the guess verdict has
