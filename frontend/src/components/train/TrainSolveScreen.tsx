/**
 * TrainSolveScreen — the guess -> one move -> grade -> verdict slice of the
 * Train solve loop (SOLV-01/02/03/04, D-05/D-06/D-13, Phase 190 Plans 01+04).
 *
 * D-05 (LOCKED): the board is fully visible for study but rejects every
 * piece input until the user commits a binary guess ("One critical move" /
 * "Several fine moves"); the guess buttons sit where the move prompt lives.
 * After the guess, exactly one move is accepted (SOLV-02) — every subsequent
 * drop is rejected.
 *
 * Grading (SOLV-03): `startGrading(puzzle.fen)` fires once per puzzle at
 * MOUNT (190-RESEARCH.md Open Question 1 — resolved at mount to maximise the
 * D-06 fast-path hit rate), not gated on the guess. `correct_guess` is read
 * ONLY from the server's `SolveResponse` — never recomputed client-side
 * (POOL-10).
 *
 * Persistence (190-04 Task 3, T-190-12): once grading resolves, the verdict
 * renders from `trainSession.lastSolveResponse` (the solve mutation's own
 * `data`) rather than a copy held in local state — so a retried solve
 * (`trainSession.retrySolve`) surfaces its result exactly the same way a
 * first-try success does, with no separate wiring. `advance()` itself is a
 * no-op until the CURRENT puzzle's solve has actually succeeded (the hook's
 * own gate); the Next button's `disabled` attribute mirrors that but is not
 * the only thing enforcing it (defense in depth — the hook's gate is what the
 * forced-failure test actually asserts against).
 *
 * Plan 05 replaces the inline verdict/error/Next block with `TrainReveal`
 * (the reveal panel — verdicts, honest copy, best line, opt-in tactic
 * stepper, game card, deep link). `TrainReveal` fetches the reveal GET, the
 * game card, and the tactic-lines PV itself, all gated on the solve response
 * being present (T-190-16) — none of that data is requested before the
 * solve POST resolves.
