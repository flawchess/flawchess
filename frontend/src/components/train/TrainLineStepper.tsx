/**
 * TrainLineStepper — a small, single-chain SAN move stepper for the Train
 * reveal's engine-line boxes (Your move / Best move / Played in game). No
 * branching, no forking, no deletion. (The opt-in tactic-line steppers it
 * also served were removed per 190.1 UAT round 4 — confusing, not needed.)
 *
 * This is the settled answer to the ROADMAP's plan-time "embed the analysis
 * page's branching-tree editor vs. build a lightweight stepper" question:
 * that existing component (1097 LOC) is a node-map graph with sibling-block
 * forking, line deletion, and click-to-fetch chip handlers — all coupled to
 * the analysis page's branching-tree editor state. None of that is needed
 * for a single linear line, so this is a fresh, small, purpose-built
 * component instead (190-05-PLAN.md Task 1 reversibility rating: swapping it
 * later touches only its two call sites). It deliberately does not import or
 * embed that component.
 *
 * The reveal's own board is the stage (D-08/D-09 — one interactive board
 * throughout): this component never mounts its own ChessBoard. It replays
 * `moves` (SAN) from `startFen` with chess.js — mirroring the exact idiom
 * `useAnalysisBoard.ts`'s `insertPvLine` already uses (`new Chess(startFen)`,
 * then `chess.move(san)` per step, breaking rather than throwing on an
 * illegal SAN) — and reports the derived FEN at the current index via
 * `onFenChange`, which the reveal wires to the shared board's position state.
 *
 * Phase 200 (D-01): the header row (glyph / title / verdict mark / quality
 * icon / eval badge) that used to render here moved into `TrainReveal.tsx`'s
 * `CardHeader` — this component now renders only the prev/next + token row.
 * The four testids it used to own (`train-line-stepper-title`/`-mark`/
 * `-quality`/`-eval`) moved with it, unchanged.
