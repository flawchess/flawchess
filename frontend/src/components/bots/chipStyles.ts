/**
 * chipStyles — the ONE definition of the Bots setup screen's toggle-chip look,

 * chips, `PlayStyleControl`'s Human/Engine preset chips).
 *
 * Phase 171 code review (WR-05): `SetupScreen` had already extracted these three
 * constants, but `PlayStyleControl` — a sibling rendered on the SAME screen —
 * re-typed the identical class strings inline, twice. A restyle of the setup
 * chips would have changed one file and silently diverged the other, which is
 * exactly the duplicated-markup drift CLAUDE.md's "search for duplicated markup
 * before considering a change complete" rule targets. These are layout/state
 * utility classes over existing semantic theme tokens (`toggle-active`,
 * `inactive-bg`), not new color values, so they belong here rather than in
 * `theme.ts` (which owns the token VALUES these classes reference).
