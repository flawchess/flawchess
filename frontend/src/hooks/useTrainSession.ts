/**
 * useTrainSession — the orchestrating hook for the Train session/solve loop
 * (mirrors useBotGame.ts's "one hook owns the loop" shape).
 *
 * Composes two TanStack Query mutations (`composeOrResumeSession`,
 * `solvePuzzle`) with the derived puzzle-queue state: the frozen `puzzles`
 * array from the session response, and `currentIndex` seeded to 0 — NEVER
 * `solved_count` (bug fix, 190-06 UAT checkpoint; see below).
 *
 * Bug fix (190-06 UAT): `currentIndex` used to seed from
 * `TrainSessionResponse.solved_count` on the theory that `puzzles` was always
 * the FULL session array and solved_count was the number to skip over. That
 * is wrong for a resumed session: the backend's resume path
 * (`load_session_puzzles`, `app/repositories/train_repository.py`) returns
 * ONLY the not-yet-attempted puzzles (`drill_solves.solved_at IS NULL`),
 * ordered by position — never the already-solved ones. So `puzzles.length`
 * on resume is `puzzle_count - solved_count`, and indexing at `solved_count`
 * overshoots the array, leaving `currentPuzzle` permanently null — the
 * "Resume session — N of M done" button rendered correctly (it reads
 * `solved_count`/`puzzle_count` directly) but clicking it did nothing,
 * because `Train.tsx`'s `showLoop` gate never turned true.
 * `puzzles[0]` IS the correct resume point in BOTH the fresh case (the full
 * array, so index 0 is the first puzzle) and the resume case (already only
 * the remaining puzzles, so index 0 is the next unsolved one) — the array's
 * own ordering already encodes "what to solve next," `solved_count` must
 * never be used as an array index. It IS still needed as the baseline for
 * the progress indicator's "i of N" display (see `TrainSolveScreen.tsx`),
 * since `currentIndex` alone only counts progress WITHIN this frontend
 * session, not the puzzles already solved before it loaded.
 *
 * `POST /train/sessions` is the ONLY endpoint that can tell the landing
 * screen (190-04, D-01..D-04/D-14) whether the user has a fresh/short/
 * resumable/completed/empty session — there is no separate preview GET. The
 * call is resume-safe (idempotent per local day, see
 * `compose_and_materialize_session`'s docstring), so `Train.tsx` fires
 * `startSession()` automatically on mount as a STATUS fetch; D-01's "no
 * auto-start on visit" is about never skipping straight into the solve loop
 * UI, not about avoiding this read. Pressing Start/Resume only flips local
 * loop-entry state — it does not call this again.
 *
 * UAT bug fix (191-06): `startSession()` IS re-fired once more, from
 * `TrainScheduleSettings`'s `onSaved` callback (threaded through
 * `TrainStartScreen`'s `onSettingsSaved` prop to `Train.tsx`'s own
 * `startSession`) after a schedule-settings save actually persists. Without
 * this, an untouched session composed at mount under the OLD
 * `puzzles_per_session` stayed frozen at the stale size for the rest of the
 * visit even after the setting changed — the backend's own resize-discard
 * (`_discard_if_untouched_and_resized`) only runs on the NEXT compose call,
 * and nothing else on this page ever makes one.
 *
 * `sessionScore` (190-04 D-03, replaced 260728-tgc/BUGFIX-TRAIN-SCORE-CROSSDEVICE):
 * seeded from the session response's `solved_results` — the server-returned
 * per-puzzle outcomes — via the same `scorePuzzle` + `aggregateSessionScore`
 * pair from `@/lib/trainScore` that grades a live solve, then accumulated in
 * memory as the loop progresses. This replaces a client-accumulated,
 * localStorage-backed tally keyed by `session_id`, which read "0 of N" on any
 * device that had not itself seen the original solve responses — reproduced
 * in production (user 28, session 27: 14/18 on the solving device, 0/18 on a
 * second device). `solved_results` is server data, so the recap is now
 * correct everywhere.
 *
 * Block-and-retry solve persistence (190-04 Task 3, T-190-12/T-190-15): a
 * failed solve POST must never silently cost the user's spaced-repetition
 * progress. `advance()` is a no-op until the CURRENT puzzle's solve mutation
 * has actually succeeded (tracked via `solvedPositions`, keyed by
 * `TrainPuzzle.position`); `retrySolve()` re-submits the EXACT payload from
 * the last `solvePuzzle` call — never re-derived/re-graded, so a retry
 * cannot change the answer. `lastSolveResponse` mirrors the solve mutation's
 * own TanStack `data` (not a separate copy) so a retry's eventual success
 * surfaces through the same rendering path as a first-try success, with no
 * extra wiring; `resetSolve` clears it per-puzzle so a stale verdict/error
 * never bleeds into the next puzzle's initial render.
