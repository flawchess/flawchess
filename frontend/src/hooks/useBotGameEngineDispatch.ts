/**
 * useBotGameEngineDispatch — bot-engine dispatch sub-hook of useBotGame
 * (Phase 215, SC-1). Owns the Stockfish/Maia provider lifecycle
 * (`poolRef`/`queueRef`, warm-on-mount + terminate-on-unmount), the D-16
 * honest-clock, deadline-managed `runBotTurn` dispatcher (169.5 opening
 * book, D-07/D-08 resign + draw-offer housekeeping), and the
 * `runBotTurnRef` "always call the latest closure" indirection.
 *
 * REF-INDIRECTION PRESERVED (215-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 4): `runBotTurnRef` is
 * assigned by an effect inside this hook (`runBotTurnRef.current =
 * runBotTurn`) and returned alongside `runBotTurn` itself. The deferred
 * caller — `useBotGame.ts`'s bot-turn-trigger effect — MUST keep reading
 * `runBotTurnRef.current?.(...)`, never the hook's `runBotTurn` return
 * value directly, or the stale-closure bug this ref exists to prevent
 * reappears.
 *
 * FULL ENCAPSULATION where possible (same rationale as useBotGameClock.ts):
 * `poolRef`/`queueRef` never leave this module (their only external
 * consumer, `retryEngineWarm`, moved in with them). `abortControllerRef`
 * and `runBotTurnRef`, like `runBotTurnRef` itself, DO cross the boundary
 * (read by `finalizeGame`/`newGame` and the bot-turn-trigger effect, which
 * stay in `useBotGame.ts` through 215-03) — every such caller's dependency
 * array gains the ref explicitly (behaviorally inert: ref identity never
 * changes) rather than silently drifting the phase's `react-hooks/*`
 * warning count.
 *
 * `delay`/`buildBotMoveDeps`/`resolveBookMove`/`styleNameFor` move here,
 * non-exported: `runBotTurn` is now their only reader (215-03-PLAN.md
 * Task 2 — "move [module-level helpers] with the cluster and keep them
 * non-exported" when the new hook becomes their only reader).
