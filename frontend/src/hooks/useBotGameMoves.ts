/**
 * useBotGameMoves — move-commit sub-hook of useBotGame (Phase 215, SC-1).
 * Owns the shared commit path (`commitMove`, used by both the user's
 * `attemptMove` and the bot's `runBotTurn` in
 * `useBotGameEngineDispatch.ts`), view-only ply navigation (`viewPly`,
 * `returnToLive`, `updateViewedPly`), and the confirmed-resign action.
 *
 * `commitMove` mutates `chessRef` directly and is read from by several
 * OTHER clusters (`useBotGameEngineDispatch`'s `runBotTurn` calls it;
 * `useBotGame.ts`'s `newGame` resets the board `chessRef` points at), so
 * this hook takes `chessRef` — and every clock/snapshot/draw-offer
 * callback `commitMove` needs — through its options object rather than
 * owning them (215-03-PLAN.md Task 3). `viewedPlyRef`/`hasUnlockedAudioRef`
 * ARE owned here: every reader of both is one of this hook's own six
 * functions, so — unlike `chessRef` — there is no cross-cluster consumer
 * to preserve access for.
 *
 * Called AFTER useBotGameSnapshot/useBotGameClock/useBotGameDrawOffer (its
 * `finalizeGame`/`buildSnapshot`/`applyMoveDebit`/`getClockBase`/
 * `resetTurnAnchor`/`chargeableElapsedMs`/`flagIfOutOfTime`/
 * `botDrawOfferRef`/`setBotDrawOffer`/`movesSinceLastDeclineRef`
 * dependencies), BEFORE useBotGameEngineDispatch (which needs this hook's
 * `commitMove` as an option) — the exact position `commitMove` already
 * occupied in `useBotGame.ts` before this extraction.
