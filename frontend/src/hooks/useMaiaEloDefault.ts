/**
 * useMaiaEloDefault — encapsulates the D-06/D-07 "you are here" ELO default
 * derivation for the Maia surfaces (ELO selector + chart + bar), kept out of
 * Analysis.tsx's already-large render (CLAUDE.md "refactor bloated code on sight").
 *
 * D-07 default rules:
 *   - Game mode: the SIDE-TO-MOVE's color rating-AT-GAME-TIME, preferring the
 *     Lichess-blitz-normalized rating (`gameData.white_rating_lichess_blitz` /
 *     `.black_rating_lichess_blitz`, Phase 164) when present, else the raw
 *     `gameData.white_rating` / `.black_rating` — so on the opponent's move the ELO
 *     defaults to the opponent's (normalized) rating, matching who is actually choosing
 *     the move (quick 260705-m3z). `sideToMove` omitted → falls back to `gameData.user_color`.
 *     Never the frozen current-rating snapshot.
 *   - Free play (Phase 171 D-08): the user's normalized `profile.lichess_blitz_equivalent_rating`
 *     (the blitz-bucket anchor, Phase 171 D-07), else the FREE_PLAY_DEFAULT_ELO (1500)
 *     midpoint fallback. Deliberately NOT `profile.current_rating` — that is the raw
 *     platform rating from the user's most recent game, which is inflated for
 *     chess.com users relative to the Maia/Lichess-blitz scale this slider is on.
 *   - The resolved default is clamped to the MAIA_ELO_LADDER's [min, max] bounds
 *     (NOT snapped to its 100-ELO steps — a rating like 1720 stays 1720; only the
 *     ladder's outer bounds are enforced. useMaiaEngine's own `nearestByElo` picks
 *     the closest ladder rung for inference regardless of the exact selectedElo).
 *   - Once the user picks a value via the ELO selector, that pick wins permanently
 *     (user-override precedence) — a later gameData/profile load does not clobber it.
 *
 * Phase 172 (SEED-106 D-01): `deriveRawDefault` and `clampToLadderBounds` are now
 * exported (previously module-private) so the background gem sweep can pin each
 * ply's gem rung to the MOVER's own rating-at-game-time without re-deriving the
 * fallback chain a second time. This hook's own `selectedElo` state and the
 * user-override precedence above are UNCHANGED — the slider still owns the live
 * exploration overlay; only the gem rung stops tracking it.
