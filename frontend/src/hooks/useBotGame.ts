/**
 * useBotGame — the orchestrating game-loop hook for clocked bot play (Phase
 * 169). Composes the plan-01/02/03 pure modules (chessClock, botGameEnd,
 * botDrawGate, botGamePgn, sounds) with the frozen `selectBotMove` engine core
 * (Phase 166/168.5) and chess.js. This is pure orchestration — chess.js owns
 * rules/legality/end-conditions, `selectBotMove` owns move selection, the
 * plan-01/02/03 modules own timing/end-detection/draw-gate/PGN/sound. This
 * hook wires them and exposes the stable state+callbacks contract Phases 170
 * (localStorage resume) and 171 (setup screen + store-on-finish) build on.
 *
 * `viewedPly` and `liveGamePly` are modeled as two SEPARATE numbers (D-13,
 * 169-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 5's two-independent-state-pieces lesson applied to
 * viewing-vs-live state) — `liveGamePly` is always `moveHistory.length`;
 * `viewedPly` is the ply the board currently displays (view-only when it
 * differs from `liveGamePly`).
 *
 * CLOCK MODEL (D-15/D-16, 2026-07-13 gap closure — supersedes the original
 * 168.5 never-flag model this hook shipped with): the bot's clock is HONEST.
 * On commit it is debited exactly the real wall-clock time its turn consumed
 * (search + reveal delay), plus the Fischer increment — the same rule the
 * user's clock obeys. There is no synthetic fraction-of-remaining debit and
 * no never-flag clamp anywhere in this file; the bot CAN lose on time
 * (amended ROADMAP SC1), and that invariant is ENFORCED at the commit site —
 * `hasFlaggedOnDebit` (chessClock.ts), called via the `flagIfOutOfTime`
 * helper before the move is applied in both `attemptMove` and `runBotTurn` —
 * not merely absent from this file (Plan 10 gap closure, CR-02). Because a
 * fixed search budget under an honest clock is degenerate (the bot would
 * bleed net time every move), the bot manages its own pace via a per-move
 * think deadline (`computeThinkDeadlineMs`, chessClock.ts D-16) injected
 * into `selectBotMove` through the `deps.search` seam
 * (`createDeadlineSearch`, deadlineSearch.ts) — a deadline cut returns the
 * search's best-so-far move (D-17); it never discards the turn. Only a
 * genuine CANCEL (resign / new game / unmount / bot flagged) discards a
 * turn. D-19: this means the bot's calibrated ELO (measured at the full
 * node budget) holds only when it is NOT low on its own clock — a
 * deadline-cut bot in time trouble plays materially weaker than advertised,
 * by design (humans get worse in time trouble too).
 *
 * D-20/WR-02 (hidden-tab hardening, Plan 10 gap closure CR-01): every
 * elapsed-time consumer in this file — the clock tick's flag check, the
 * bot's committed debit, and the user's move debit — reads through the ONE
 * pause-aware `chargeableElapsedMs` helper (wrapping chessClock.ts's
 * `computeChargeableElapsedMs`), so a hidden interval reaches neither the
 * tick's flag check nor the committed debit, for either side. The
 * anchor-reset helper (`resetTurnAnchor`) still re-baselines an in-progress
 * pause alongside the turn anchor on every commit, so a move committing
 * while the tab is hidden can never produce a future-dated anchor on
 * resume.
 *
 * WR-03/WR-05 (finalize idempotency, scroll-back preservation): `finalizeGame`
 * is latched by `outcomeRef` — the first outcome wins, and every caller
 * (including the async draw-resolution effect, which can run after the game
 * has already ended) checks it before doing anything. `commitMove` snaps
 * `viewedPly` to the live position only when the viewer was already live (or
 * the mover is the user, who can only move from the live position anyway) —
 * a bot move no longer ejects the user from D-13 scroll-back.
 *
 * RESUME SEAM + LIVE GATE (Phase 170, D-10/D-03/D-11): an optional `resume`
 * argument lazily seeds every ref/state value below from a `BotGameSnapshot`
 * instead of a fresh-game default — ONE hook, ONE game loop, no second
 * restore path. A resumed game mounts with `live: false`: the provider
 * bring-up effect (pool/queue warm) still fires unconditionally, but the
 * turn-anchor, clock-tick, and bot-turn-trigger effects wait for the caller
 * to call `confirmLive()` (from the resume gate's Resume button) before any
 * clock runs or search starts — "nobody pays for the engine cold-start" and
 * "no away-time billed" (D-01/D-02/D-03). `gameUuidRef` is minted once at
 * game start, carried through a resume unchanged, and re-minted ONLY by
 * `newGame()` (D-11) — this is what keeps the server's
 * `uq_games_user_platform_game_id` idempotency reachable across a resume.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE (Phase 170 Plan 04, D-01/D-02/D-12): this hook owns every
 * localStorage write for the in-progress snapshot and the finished-game
 * pending-store queue, at exactly FOUR call sites: (1) `commitMove` writes a
 * fresh snapshot after every committed move (no fold — the base is already
 * settled); (2) a dedicated tab-hide/`pagehide` effect writes a snapshot
 * with the D-01/D-02 fold applied (bills the user's in-turn think time,
 * refunds the bot's interrupted one); (3) `finalizeGame` enqueues the
 * finished game to `flawchess_bot_pending_store` and clears the in-progress
 * snapshot; (4) `newGame` clears the in-progress snapshot only. Call site
 * (3) is the ONLY `enqueuePendingStore` call site in the codebase — this is
 * what makes SC2 ("an abandoned game leaves no server trace") STRUCTURAL:
 * the POST that eventually drains the queue can only ever be fed by a
 * FINISHED game, because nothing else ever writes into that queue.
