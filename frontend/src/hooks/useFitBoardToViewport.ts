/**
 * useFitBoardToViewport — the largest square-board width that still leaves a
 * board column (everything the column renders around the board, plus a bottom
 * gutter) fully inside a short viewport.
 *
 * Bug fix (191 UAT): the Train solve screen used to size its board column with
 * a CSS-only `min(MAX, max(MIN, calc(100dvh - RESERVED)))`, where RESERVED was
 * one hard-coded estimate of the vertical chrome around the board. A single
 * constant cannot know what the page renders ABOVE the column (most visibly
 * the dev-only time-travel strip, but equally a taller mobile button row or an
 * extra prompt line), so on a short window it under-reserved and the
 * Solution/Analyze/Next row ended up flush against the bottom edge. This hook
 * measures the real chrome instead, so the gutter below the board stays honest
 * at every viewport height and in every build.
 *
 * The measurement converges in one pass rather than feeding back on itself:
 * both inputs — `column.offsetHeight - board.offsetHeight` (everything in the
 * column that is NOT the board, gaps included) and the column's
 * document-relative top — are independent of the width this hook returns.
 *
 * Caller contract: apply the returned number to BOTH the column's `max-width`
 * and the board's own `maxWidth`, so sibling rows (progress bar, button row)
 * keep spanning exactly the board's width.
