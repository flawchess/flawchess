/**
 * useGemSweep — the background gem-sweep cascade (Phase 172, SEED-106 D-04/D-05).
 *
 * ─── DEMOTED to a fallback-only mechanism (Phase 175, SEED-108 D-01/D-01a) ──
 *
 * An analyzed game's mainline is no longer swept: it is rendered directly
 * from the backend's stored `game_best_moves` / `EvalPoint.best_move_tier`
 * data (Analysis.tsx's `storedTierByPly`/`resolveMarkerFor`), which is
 * instant and requires no Maia/Stockfish round-trip. This hook's own
 * candidates (below) are computed from `eval_series`, so its `enabled` gate
 * is ANDed with `!gameHasStoredBestMoveData` at the call site
 * (Analysis.tsx) — the sweep now only ever has real work for a game whose
 * mainline eval data exists but has NOT yet had `best_move_tier` populated
 * (pre-Phase-176-backfill), which does not happen through this hook's own
 * candidate source once that data is present. The dedicated-worker
 * machinery below is kept intact, NOT deleted (D-01), as the documented
 * fallback for exactly that "no stored tier available" case — SEED-107 (the
 * original sweep-starvation seed) closes as superseded by this design.
 *
 * Runs the SAME resolution `Analysis.tsx`'s live gem badge already performs
 * (Maia C1 -> Stockfish parent-grade C2), one candidate at a time, AHEAD of
 * the cursor instead of AT it — for every ply that survived the D-04 free
 * prefilter (`gemSweep.ts#selectSweepCandidates`).
 *
 * ─── Dedicated workers, never shared (the load-bearing decision) ───────────
 *
 * This hook calls `useMaiaEngine` and `useStockfishGradingEngine` itself,
 * driven ONLY by sweep state — two Worker instances SEPARATE from
 * `Analysis.tsx`'s `maia` / `grading` / `gemGrading` calls. Two structural
 * reasons this cannot be a shared instance:
 *
 *  1. `useMaiaEngine.analyze()` keeps a SINGLE inference in flight and
 *     silently DROPS a second concurrent `analyze()` call rather than
 *     queuing it (useMaiaEngine.ts:180-187). Driving the live curve's
 *     instance with a sweep FEN would occupy the only in-flight slot and
 *     inject the sweep's full inference latency onto the live path.
 *  2. `useStockfishGradingEngine` is a single-FEN state machine with no
 *     queue and no priority (prepareSearch, ~line 213). Feeding it a
 *     background FEN would make the sweep and the live grade `stop`/re-`go`
 *     each other's in-flight WASM search on every prop change.
 *
 * A dedicated instance makes starvation of the live path STRUCTURALLY
 * impossible instead of merely unlikely — see 172-04-PLAN.md's objective for
 * the full dedicated-workers-vs-workerPool.ts-priority-queue rationale.
 *
 * ─── Yield semantics — the one deviation from RESEARCH's suggested design ──
 *
 * RESEARCH.md suggested aborting the in-flight sweep search on every cursor
 * change. This hook does NOT do that: a user stepping briskly through the
 * mainline (the exact behavior this phase exists to serve) would cancel the
 * sweep continuously and it would never finish. Instead the sweep yields at
 * the DISPATCH gate ONLY — `nextSweepDispatch` (gemSweep.ts) never lets a NEW
 * candidate START while the live path is busy — and the cost of work already
 * started is bounded by `SWEEP_GRADING_MOVETIME_MS` (below). This is safe
 * precisely BECAUSE the workers are dedicated: an in-flight sweep search
 * occupies no resource the live path needs. For the Maia tier specifically,
 * this hook follows the project's own established precedent
 * (`useFlawChessEngine.ts`): "maiaQueue has no stopAll (an in-flight ONNX
 * inference cannot be interrupted) — a stale policy() resolution is unused
 * and harmless." A stale sweep Maia/Stockfish result is simply written to
 * this hook's own map, never forced onto the live display.
 *
 * ─── Cache (Pitfall 4) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `gemByPly` is this hook's OWN state, bounded by `candidates.length`
 * (mainline-only, D-02) and deliberately NEVER FIFO-capped like
 * `Analysis.tsx`'s `gemByNode`/`maiaCurveByFen` (a 256-entry cap that is a
 * budget SHARED by four maps and free-variation exploration) — a swept
 * move-8 gem must not be evicted before the user reaches move 60.

/**

 * (useStockfishGradingEngine.ts). The sweep has no deadline to hit; a shorter
 * cap bounds how long any single background candidate pegs a CPU core,
 * trading grading depth for lower per-candidate wall-clock cost. This is an
 * acceptable trade specifically for the sweep's C2 comparison — a gem
 * requires the played move to beat the runner-up by at least `MISTAKE_DROP`
 * (a large expected-score gap), not a fine one, so a shallower search still
 * resolves it correctly the vast majority of the time. 1000ms is roughly the
 * live free-run's own `MOVETIME_MS` order of magnitude (RESEARCH.md's
