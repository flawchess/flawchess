/**
 * useBoardNavigationInput — shared arrow-key + mouse-wheel move browsing for
 * chess boards (Quick 260821-kyz).
 *
 * Extracted from useAnalysisBoard so the Openings board gets identical
 * behavior instead of a second, weaker copy of the guards (the previous
 * Openings handler checked only INPUT/TEXTAREA/SELECT: no defaultPrevented,
 * modifier, contentEditable or modal guard, no container scoping, no
 * repeat throttle, and no wheel support at all).
 *
 * Two input surfaces:
 * - Keyboard: window-scoped so ArrowLeft/ArrowRight work without first
 *   clicking the board (lichess parity). Six guards, cheapest first, keep it
 *   from hijacking keys that belong elsewhere — see handleKeyDown. A consumer
 *   may also pass `goHome` to bind the Home key (the Train reveal's "back to
 *   the puzzle position", Phase 237); without it Home is left alone.
 * - Wheel: board-scoped. Wheel down goes forward, wheel up goes back, and the
 *   page never scrolls while the pointer is over the board. Rate limited by
 *   an accumulated-delta threshold plus a time throttle so a trackpad flick
 *   advances a handful of moves, not the whole game.
 *
 * Both surfaces are inert while every container ref is null — that is how a
 * consumer opts out entirely (a hook that never attaches one) without
 * needing a separate flag. Consumers pass more than one ref when the page
 * keeps its desktop and mobile boards mounted at the same time and hides one
 * with CSS (Openings): the wheel handler then accepts a pointer over either,
 * and only the visible one can ever receive the event anyway.
