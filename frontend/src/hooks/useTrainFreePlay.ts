/**
 * useTrainFreePlay — Phase 200 (EXPLORE-01/02/04/05, reworked per Phase 200
 * UAT): the post-verdict free-play surface for the Train reveal board.
 *
 * UAT change from the original single-chain `useTrainExploration`: free play
 * now runs on the SAME branching move tree the Analysis page uses
 * (`useAnalysisBoard`), so sidelines behave exactly as they do there — playing
 * a move from a jumped-back position FORKS a new variation instead of
 * truncating the tail, every open line stays visible in the move list
 * (`VariationTree`), and a line closes via its own × affordance. The linear
 * "stepper" model is gone.
 *
 * It also grades every freely played move. The grade uses the SAME
 * expected-score pipeline as the solve verdict (`classifyTrainMoveQuality`
 * over `liveFlaw`'s sigmoid): the parent position's completed engine eval vs
 * the child position's, with "was it the engine's own top move" answered from
 * the parent's rank-1 PV. ONE exception (Phase 211, D-06): a non-best ROOT-ply
 * move that matches the SERVED vetted list (`FreePlaySeedEval.vettedMoves` —
 * the same `SolveResponse.vetted_moves` the reveal's "Also fine" row draws)
 * is badged with that entry's own server-computed quality, never re-derived
 * from evals, so the badge can never contradict the list (SEED-137 case 2).
 * Deliberately NO Maia (Phase 200 UAT): the Train loop
 * never loads the ONNX runtime, so what the Analysis page would call a gem or
 * a great move is labelled plainly `best` here.
 *
 * Two engines are in play on the solve screen and they are separate Worker
 * objects with no shared dispatch queue: the session-scoped grading engine
 * (`useTrainGradingEngine`, untouched by this hook) and the free-play engine
 * created below, which exists only while `isExploring` and is torn down by
 * `useStockfishEngine`'s own lifecycle the moment that flips false.
