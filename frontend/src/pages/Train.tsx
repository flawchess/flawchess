/**
 * Train — the /train page (Phase 190 Plans 01+04).
 *
 * Default export (required by React.lazy in App.tsx, mirroring Bots.tsx /
 * Analysis.tsx's divergence from the app's named-export convention).
 *
 * D-01 (LOCKED): visiting /train never auto-starts a session — the landing
 * always shows a status line plus a single Start/Resume button, and the loop
 * begins only on that press. `useTrainSession.startSession()` is fired
 * automatically on MOUNT below, but that is a status READ (there is no
 * separate preview endpoint — see useTrainSession.ts's module docstring),
 * not entering the loop: `hasEnteredLoop` is the only thing that reveals
 * `TrainSolveScreen`, and it flips only on a user press inside
 * `TrainStartScreen`.
 *
 * The grading engine's Worker is created HERE, at the page level — session
 * scope, not per-puzzle (190-RESEARCH.md Pattern 4) — and threaded down to
 * `TrainSolveScreen` so exactly one Worker exists for the whole session.
 *
 * Plan 05 Task 3 (SOLV-07) adds the session-complete -> score-screen
 * transition: when the final puzzle's solve response reports
 * `session_complete` and the user presses Next on its reveal, `handleNext`
 * shows `TrainScoreScreen` instead of calling `trainSession.advance()` (which
 * would otherwise leave `currentPuzzle` parked on the last puzzle rather than
 * becoming null — there is no "puzzle past the end" state to fall through to
 * automatically). `showScoreScreen` is local view state, not the accurate
 * source of truth on a later day's revisit — that's `TrainStartScreen`'s
 * pre-existing 'completed' landing state (190-04), which reads real session
 * data on a fresh mount instead of this transient in-session flag. The score
 * screen's "Done" (SEED-122) routes into exactly that state via
 * `returnToLanding`, which re-reads session status rather than merely
 * flipping the flag back.
 *
 * 190.1 UAT round 5: leaving a reveal via its Analyze deep link and pressing
 * the browser back button restores that puzzle's SOLVED reveal (not the
 * start screen) from the sessionStorage cache written on the Analyze click —
 * see `trainRevealCache.ts` and the `restoredReveal` state below.
