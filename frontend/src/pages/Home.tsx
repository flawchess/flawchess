// Single source for both the rendered accordion and the JSON-LD FAQPage schema.
//
// Why the schema is needed at all: Radix's AccordionContent is not rendered while
// collapsed, so the prerendered HTML (vite-prerender-plugin, see src/prerender.tsx)
// contains only the questions — every answer body is invisible to crawlers. The
// JSON-LD block below is what actually gets the answers indexed, and it makes the
// page eligible for FAQ rich results.
//
// `answer` is plain text and is ALWAYS the schema source of truth. `richAnswer` is
// only for the few entries that need inline links; when present it supersedes
// `answer` in the UI, so its prose must mirror `answer` or the two will drift.

    question: 'How can I improve my chess with FlawChess?',
    answer:
      'In three ways. First, analysis finds the flaws: Stockfish runs over your whole chess.com and lichess history and tags mistakes with missed and allowed tactics. Second, training helps you fix them: your own blunders come back as puzzles on a spaced-repetition schedule, mixed with quiet positions where several moves are fine, until the patterns stick. Third, you can practise against human-like bots powered by the FlawChess Engine: 24 named opponents with different ELO ratings and playing style. Every game you finish becomes an analyzable game in your library like any other.',
