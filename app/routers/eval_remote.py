"""Endpoints for the remote eval worker protocol (Phase 120 SEED-048).

Phase 149-03 PRUNE-01: the original Gen-1 POST /lease + POST /submit pair (and
_apply_submit) has been deleted — the fleet fully migrated to the atomic
(versioned) /atomic-lease + /atomic-submit pair below (Phase 147 SEED-074 Part
B), which closes the ungated-tag window the Gen-1 pair left open. See
149-RESEARCH.md for the deletion's Runtime State Inventory / zero-legacy-
traffic verification.

POST /eval/remote/entry-lease  — (Phase 123 SEED-051 D-07) claim a batch of pending
                                 entry-ply (import-time) games. D-5 backlog existence probe
                                 gates this endpoint; returns 204 when backlog < threshold.
POST /eval/remote/entry-submit — (Phase 123 SEED-051 D-07) apply depth-15 entry-ply evals
                                 via the no-shift SEED-044 write path (_apply_eval_results).
POST /eval/remote/atomic-lease — (Phase 147 SEED-074 Part B, D-02) versioned lease for the
                                 eval+blob worker pipeline. Claims via claim_eval_job
                                 (tier-1 > tier-2 > tier-3), returns the FEN-per-ply shape
                                 (_build_lease_positions, shared with the deleted Gen-1 /lease).
POST /eval/remote/atomic-submit — (Phase 147 SEED-074 Part B, D-01/D-02) paired with
                                 /atomic-lease. Applies full-ply evals + the worker's own
                                 MultiPV-2 continuation blobs together, in ONE write_session:
                                 evals -> server-authoritative classify_game_flaws (with the
                                 worker's blobs as gate input only, never trusted for flaw
                                 membership) -> blob write -> SEED-045 bounded-retry stamping
                                 (same Path A/B/C invariant _apply_submit used to use, CR-01)
                                 -> one commit. No ungated window is ever observable for a
                                 game processed here (see _apply_atomic_submit).
POST /eval/remote/bestmove-lease — (Phase 177 BACK-02/03, D-02) dedicated, isolated tier-4b
                                 best-move backfill lease. Server-recomputes the candidate-ply
                                 set (out-of-book, played == stored best_move) from already-
                                 stored full-pass data — no engine calls; the worker runs the
                                 N targeted MultiPV=2 runner-up searches (S-05).
POST /eval/remote/bestmove-submit — (Phase 177 BACK-02/03, D-02/S-06) paired with
                                 /bestmove-lease. Writes ONLY game_best_moves rows + stamps
                                 best_moves_completed_at (see _apply_bestmove_submit) —
                                 structurally isolated from apply_full_eval / the flaw write
                                 path (T-177-07).

All endpoints require the X-Operator-Token header (T-120-01 operator auth gate).
403 when the token is not configured on the server (fail-closed); 401 when it does
not match. Token comparison is constant-time (hmac.compare_digest — no timing oracle).

Expected / non-exception status codes (do NOT Sentry-capture):
  403 — token not configured
  401 — wrong token
  204 — empty queue (atomic-lease) or shallow backlog (entry-lease) or over-cap
        fat game (atomic-lease) — lichess-eval games are no longer deferred here
        (Phase 174-06/SEED-109)
  422 — SF version mismatch (entry-submit / atomic-submit) or foreign/out-of-range
        blob token (flaw-blob-submit / atomic-submit)
  404 — game not found (atomic-submit)

The server owns ALL storage convention (D-2): workers are dumb FEN→eval functions.
The atomic-submit endpoint calls _apply_full_eval_results with the worker's ply-keyed
evals; the SEED-044 +1 post-move shift is applied there, not by the worker.
The entry-submit endpoint calls _apply_eval_results (no shift) — entry-ply targets are
already position-keyed at the correct row; do NOT use _apply_full_eval_results.

    games so the last played ply's after-eval can be resolved at submit time —
    SEED-044 pitfall 3; False for lichess-eval games, mirroring the submit side's
    own `include_terminal=not is_lichess_eval_game` — their %evals are never
    shifted, so no terminal eval-donor is ever needed there, Phase 174-06).

    SEED-076 (cache-aware incremental lease): for ENGINE games, positions already
    fillable server-side — cached openings (in `opening_position_eval`) and plies
    whose DB row already has an eval — are omitted so a weak/slow worker never
    re-grinds them (the exact repeated opening timeout that permanently stamped
    user 218's games). See `_lease_position_redundant`. The terminal donor is
    always kept, and if the filter empties the lease (e.g. a board-over game with
    everything already resolved) we fall back to the full list so a claimed game
    is never starved of the submit that triggers the server-side dedup fill.

    Phase 174-06 (SEED-109): this redundancy filter's premise does NOT hold for
    lichess-eval games and is skipped for them entirely (every position is always
    leased). `_lease_position_redundant`'s "incremental" check treats an already-
    eval'd DB row as evidence a PRIOR worker round already resolved that position
    (eval AND best_move together, since one engine call always produces both) —
    true for engine games, but false for lichess-eval games, whose %eval columns
    are populated at IMPORT time, never by an engine call, and carry no best_move
    at all. Applying the engine-game redundancy premise here would filter a fresh
    lichess-eval game's lease down to just ply 0 + nothing else (every OTHER ply's
    preceding row already has an %eval from import) — ply 0 is always inside the
    opening book, so the resulting submission could never produce a single
    out-of-book best-move candidate row, defeating this game type's entire reason
    for reaching /atomic-lease in the first place.

    played move's UCI at that ply, sourced directly from `_FullPlyEvalTarget.move_uci`
    (already captured during `_collect_full_ply_targets`'s own PGN walk, Pitfall 3/4 —

       FlawBlobLeasePosition entries with token="{flaw_ply}:{line}:{node_k}". Lines

    4. Mixed or fully-walkable games: return FlawBlobLeaseResponse. The worker will
       evaluate the leased FENs at MultiPV=2 and submit via /flaw-blob-submit (Plan 04).
       Sentinel lines in mixed games are written at submit time (Plan 04 handler).

    Token format (D-04a): "{flaw_ply}:{line}:{node_k}" — opaque to worker. The worker
    echoes the token unchanged on submit; the server parses it to reassemble PvNode blobs.

    Eliminates the ungated window the old /lease + /submit pair leaves open (D-01):
    the upgraded worker submits full-ply evals AND its own MultiPV-2 continuation
    blobs for the plies its LOCAL hint-classify flagged as flaws, together, in one
    request. The server NEVER trusts that hint (T-147-03 Spoofing/Tampering
    boundary) — it re-runs classify_game_flaws on its OWN game_positions and
    independently re-derives which (flaw_ply, line) pairs are structurally
    un-walkable (D-06 sentinel semantics) purely from the worker's submitted
    evals/PVs, via _derive_atomic_sentinel_lines — never from which tokens the
    worker happened to send.

    Read phase (short session, closed before CPU work): load Game + GamePosition
    rows, mirroring _apply_submit's read phase.

    Token tamper guard (T-147-02, mirrors _apply_flaw_blob_submit's T-145-09):
    every submitted blob_nodes token must parse and reference a flaw_ply within
    this game's actual ply range; anything else is rejected with 422 BEFORE any
    write happens. A token for an in-range ply the server does NOT classify as a
    flaw is intentionally NOT rejected here — the worker's local hint-classify is
    expected to sometimes diverge from the server's authoritative classify (that
    divergence is the whole reason the server re-classifies at all), so such a
    token is silently dropped later at the SQL join inside _classify_and_fill_oracle's
    blob write (no game_flaws row exists at that ply to update).

    Write phase (ONE session, mirrors _full_drain_tick Step 4 / RESEARCH.md
    "_full_drain_tick's atomic-write ordering"): delegates to eval_apply.
    apply_full_eval (Phase 150 R7 — evals -> classify_game_flaws (with the
    worker-supplied blob_map) -> write blobs -> apply_completion_decision, the
    same Path A/B/C SEED-045 bounded-retry invariant _full_drain_tick uses) -> ONE
    commit (T-117-11: no partial/ungated state is ever observable). Path A (no
    holes) and Path C (holes, MAX_EVAL_ATTEMPTS reached) stamp both completion
    markers; Path B (holes, under cap) increments full_eval_attempts and leaves
    the game pending for retry instead.

    blobs_pending=True is passed to _classify_and_fill_oracle here (a deliberate,
    documented deviation from the plan's literal "blobs_pending stays False" — see
    147-05-SUMMARY.md Deviations): tracing _classify_tactic_gated shows blobs_pending
    ONLY affects the case where flaw_pv_blobs.get(flaw_ply) is None (the flaw_ply
    key is entirely absent — i.e. the server found a flaw the worker did not blob
    at all). It has ZERO effect on a flaw with a real submitted blob (gate runs via
    apply_forcing_line_filter unconditionally) and ZERO effect on the D-06
    []-sentinel / mate-adjacent FINAL cases (both gate on `pv_blob` being present,
    not on blobs_pending). blobs_pending=True is therefore required — and safe — to
    satisfy the must_have "a flaw the server found but the worker did not blob
    writes NULL (Part A net) and is left for tier-4 backfill", which is otherwise
    unreachable with blobs_pending=False (that must_have's own explicit Task 2 test
    requires it).

    endpoint applies evals, classifies flaws, and writes gated tactic tags + PV-line
    blobs + both completion markers in ONE transaction — no ungated window is ever
    observable for a game processed here (see _apply_atomic_submit for the full

    worker_schema_version is accepted but not gated on (Q5, RESEARCH.md): the server
    re-classifies authoritatively regardless of which schema version produced the
    worker's evals/blobs, so a stale worker cannot corrupt correctness — only
    (transiently) miss the gate for plies it didn't blob, which the NULL-suppression
