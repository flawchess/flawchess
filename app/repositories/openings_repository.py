    Filters MUST be identical to query_opening_transitions for consistency.
    The caller (compute_insights) passes color=None to apply_game_filters,
    mirroring query_opening_transitions' filter behavior — both white-perspective
    and black-perspective games visiting the same position contribute to the
    same resulting-position summary the user lands on.

    Kept as a separate function (not a default-named alias) so call sites in
    openings_service vs opening_insights_service stay visually distinct, and so
    future filter divergence between the two surfaces lands cleanly.

    Returns ``{full_hash: (wins, draws, losses, last_played_at)}``. The
    last_played_at element is ``MAX(games.played_at)`` across the games that
    contributed to the WDL counts; it is ``None`` when every contributing game
    has a NULL played_at (rare; the column is nullable on Game).

    Missing hashes (no games match under filters) are omitted from the dict.
