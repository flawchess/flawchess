"""Repository for the Train reminder scheduler's SQL (Phase 201, REMIND-02..07).

All SQL for the reminder job lives HERE -- `app/services/train_reminder_service.py`
holds no statements of its own. A new module rather than more lines in
`app/repositories/train_repository.py` (already ~2450 lines).

V4 Information Disclosure mitigation: every function requires `user_id` (or
`day`/`today` scoped to a user) as a keyword-only argument. Callers MUST pass
an already-resolved user id -- from `list_reminder_candidate_user_ids`'s own
scan, never client-supplied.

    """Return user ids that MAY be due a Train reminder (D-16: SQL narrows only).

    Narrows on `reminder_enabled` + at least one live `push_subscriptions`
    row + not a guest. Returns bare ids, mirroring
    `guest_cleanup_service.get_eligible_guest_ids`, so each candidate can be
    re-loaded fresh in its own session.

    Deliberately applies NO timezone conversion and NO predicate on
    `reminder_last_sent_on`: a user's local calendar day differs from the
    database session's date by up to fourteen hours, so a SQL-side date
    comparison would both over-select (pulling in a user whose local day has
    not started) and under-select (skipping a user whose local day has
    already turned while the watermark still reads the database's today) at
    the boundary. The per-user claim UPDATE (`claim_reminder_day`), evaluated
    against that user's own already-resolved local date, is the real guard.

    Guest exclusion (REMIND-07): as of Phase 224, `/train/*` no longer 403s
    guests -- `PUT /train/settings` (and every other Train endpoint) accepts
    a guest bearer token, so a guest CAN reach `reminder_enabled=True`
    through the API. This filter is therefore load-bearing, not defence in
    depth: it is the only thing keeping a reminder from being scheduled for
    an account the 30-day cleanup may purge out from under it. The frontend
    also hides the reminder toggle from guests (Phase 224 D-13), but the UI
    is not the guard -- this SQL filter is, since this job runs behind no
    request-scoped gate.

    the rejected alternatives. `failed` never triggers this (D-15): a
    construction/encryption exception is deliberately excluded from the

    equality with `today` only (D-14). This means the release can only ever
    un-claim the day THIS tick claimed, never a later claim written by a
    second ticker, which keeps the D-07 double-send invariant structural
    rather than resting on "there is only one process". 404/410 are terminal
    statuses under RFC 8030 Sec. 7, so a pruned subscription demonstrably
