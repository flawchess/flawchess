"""Repository for the Train tables: settings + session composition (Phase 189).

Phase 189 Plan 01 (POOL-01/POOL-04/POOL-07/POOL-10, D-01/D-02/D-06/D-07/D-08/D-09)
built the SR-only composition skeleton. Phase 189 Plan 04 Task 1 widened it to
the full POOL-07 75/25 mix with honest cross-backfill; Task 2 layers the
D-09/D-10/D-11/D-12 session lifecycle on top — resume, expiry, and lazy
eviction on resume.

V4 Information Disclosure mitigation: every function requires `user_id` as a
keyword-only argument. Callers MUST pass the authenticated user's ID (from
the FastAPI-Users `current_active_user` dependency); never accept `user_id`
as a query/path parameter from the client. Mirrors

    shape. The caller (Pydantic `TrainSettingsUpdate`) has already validated
    `timezone` resolves via `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo` and that `weekday_mask`/
    `puzzles_per_session` are within the table's CHECK bounds — this function
    trusts that and does no re-validation.

    Settle-before-mutate (carried forward from Phase 191 D-18, now at
    per-day tick granularity): settlement runs STRICTLY BEFORE any new value
    is applied, judged against the OLD mask and OLD timezone:

    1. `old_row = await get_or_create_settings(...)` — reading this BEFORE
       applying any new value is load-bearing. Reading it AFTER would settle
       every elapsed unsettled scheduled day against the NEW schedule
       instead of the one that was actually in force, silently
       reintroducing the retroactive re-judging a settled day must never
       suffer. A user who was inactive for several elapsed days and then
       reschedules must have those days judged by the OLD schedule.
    2. `today = local_today(old_row.timezone, now_utc)` — resolved from the
       OLD timezone, because a timezone change moves day boundaries, and the
       elapsed days being settled belong to the old frame, not the new one.
    3. `await settle_streak_snapshot(..., settings_row=old_row, today=today)`
       — the single settlement entry point, reused verbatim; no second
       settlement implementation exists here.
    4. Only then is the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` applying the new
       `timezone`/`weekday_mask`/`puzzles_per_session` issued.

    Both the settlement UPDATE (if any) and this settings UPSERT run
    sequentially on the same `AsyncSession`, inside the caller's one
    transaction — never `asyncio.gather` (CLAUDE.md) — so a failure in
    either rolls back both, and the snapshot can never advance against a
    schedule that was never persisted.

    Deliberately does NOT re-snap existing `drill_items.due_date` values when
    `weekday_mask` changes (unchanged from the router's prior documented
    behaviour).

    REMIND-01/T-201-13: `reminder_last_sent_on` is deliberately NOT a
    parameter here and does not appear in the UPSERT's `values(...)` or
    `set_` dict below — it is the reminder job's own watermark (D-06),
    written only by its claim UPDATE (plan 201-04). A settings PUT must
    never move it, so this function structurally cannot write it.

    Phase 203 (OFFER-03/D-02): `reminder_intent_at` IS a parameter here and
    DOES appear in both `values(...)` and `set_` — the opposite access
    pattern from `reminder_last_sent_on`, since it is client-writable on
    every PUT (unlike the reminder job's own watermark, above).

            intent, or None to clear it. Required-but-nullable at the schema
            layer (D-02) — never defaulted here either.
        now_utc: The current UTC instant. Used ONLY to resolve `today` from
            the OLD (pre-mutation) timezone for the settle-before-mutate

    caller resolves `get_or_create_settings`/`local_today` exactly once per
    request (191-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2).

    Branch order, all sequential awaits (never `asyncio.gather` on this
    `AsyncSession`, CLAUDE.md):

    1. An open session that is NOT expired -> its `puzzle_count` minus its
       solved `drill_solves` count (floored at 0, mirroring `_resume_session`'s
       solved-count predicate). An expired-but-still-`open` row is skipped in
       Python here, never flipped to `'expired'` — that write belongs solely
       to `expire_stale_sessions`, never to this read path.
       EXCEPTION: an open session that `_is_untouched_and_resized` reports as
       doomed (zero solves + a `requested_count` that no longer matches the
       current `puzzles_per_session`) falls through to branch 3 instead. The
       next composition will discard and recompose it, so its frozen count is
       already dead — reporting it made the badge advertise a size the user had
       just changed away from. Predicting the discard is read-only; the delete
       stays in `_discard_if_untouched_and_resized`.
    2. Otherwise a completed session still inside its D-10 window -> 0 (D-07:
       the badge hides once today's session is done).
    3. Otherwise an estimate of available fresh material, capped at
       `settings_row.puzzles_per_session`: due `drill_items` (mirroring
       `compose_and_materialize_session`'s `due_stmt` eligibility predicates
       exactly, in COUNT-only form) + untracked `pool_entry_stmt` candidates
       (excluding already-tracked `(game_id, ply)` pairs via a SQL `NOT
       EXISTS` against `drill_items`, never materializing the pair set in
       Python) + `herring_stmt(..., exclude_served=False)` candidates.

    Never imports `classify_puzzle_type`, a `missed_pv_lines` reader,
    `fen_and_last_move_at_ply`, or any other answer-key/classification
    helper — this function needs counts and dates only (191-RESEARCH.md
    Pitfall 5). Never issues `session.add`/`session.flush`/INSERT/UPDATE/
    DELETE.

    The returned number is an UPPER BOUND, never a promise of exact session
    size: it applies composition's own eligibility predicates and the
    `puzzles_per_session` cap, but skips per-puzzle FEN reconstruction — a
    puzzle composition would later drop as unreconstructable can still be
    counted here. That is acceptable for an attention signal.

    `drill_solves` rows with `solved_at IS NULL`, ordered by `position` (the
    frozen composition order), OUTER-joined to `games` (Phase 192 D-05:
    `game_id` can be NULL after a source-game deletion, so this can no longer
    be an INNER JOIN without silently dropping puzzles) and to `herring_pool`
    for a herring's FEN/arriving move. Scoped by `user_id` in the WHERE
    clause IN ADDITION to `session_id` — a session id arriving from a request
    body/path parameter is untrusted client input (T-189-12 / V4 IDOR guard);
    a foreign session id resolves to zero rows rather than another user's
    puzzles.

    Two independent lazy-eviction paths, opposite reasons:
    - A `RED_HERRING` row reads its FEN/arriving move straight off the
      `herring_pool` row (D-03 — the only herring path, alive game-link or
      not) and is skipped only if the pool row itself is gone, handled
      identically to a broken FEN: drop, never serve. This DOES happen —
      every session composed before the pool was first generated carried a
      NULL `herring_pool_id` (prod, 2026-07-28), and `drill_solves
      .herring_pool_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so any future pool prune
      orphans in-flight rows the same way. `_mark_session_complete_if_done`
      carries the matching exclusion (SEED-123) so a dropped herring cannot
      pin the session open forever.
    - An `SR_ITEM` row is skipped when its `games` row has vanished (D-05:
      the row now survives its source game's deletion with `game_id` NULL
      instead of being CASCADE-deleted, so an orphaned SR row is unservable
      but must not be served or crash — mirrors the pre-D-05 CASCADE
      behavior) OR when its backing `game_flaws` row has since vanished under
      reclassification (pre-existing D-02 lazy eviction, unchanged).

    Rows whose FEN will not reconstruct are also skipped. The session's
    frozen `puzzle_count` is returned UNCHANGED by this function — callers
    must not derive it from `len(puzzles)` here, so `solved_count +
    len(puzzles)` may legitimately be less than `puzzle_count` after an
    eviction.

    Bug fix (191-06 UAT checkpoint round, SCHD-01): `Train.tsx` auto-fires
    `POST /train/sessions` as a status read on page MOUNT (see
    `useTrainSession.ts`'s module docstring), which can happen BEFORE the
    user has a chance to edit `TrainScheduleSettings` on the same visit.
    Pressing Start/Resume never calls this endpoint again, so a session
    materialized under a stale `puzzles_per_session` stayed frozen at the
    old size for the rest of the day even after the user changed the
    setting — "starting a session" kept showing the old requested count.

    Only a session with ZERO recorded solves is eligible: once any puzzle
    has been solved, `puzzle_count`/`session_id` are load-bearing for the
    SOLV-04/D-13 frozen progress denominator and must never move out from
    under an in-progress solve loop. Deleting an untouched
    `drill_sessions` row cascades its placeholder `drill_solves` rows
    (`ondelete="CASCADE"`); any `drill_items` padding rows created during the
    original composition are left alone — they are real, valid ACTIVE items
    and the fresh composition below will naturally pick them back up as due.

    The untouched-and-resized test itself lives in `_is_untouched_and_resized`
    (shared with `get_waiting_puzzle_count`, which must predict this discard
    without performing it); see that function for the `requested_count`-vs-
    `puzzle_count` and zero-solves rationale. This function is the WRITE half:

    1. Resolve `train_settings` (create-on-first-touch), today's local date,
       and the `(sr_slots, herring_slots)` split (`compose_slots`).
    1b. D-06 (Plan 02): stamp the `pool_eligible_since` watermark if it is
       still NULL and real material (`_material_flags`) is present — a user
       whose first `drill_items` row is created by THIS composition call
       also gets the eligibility floor immediately, without waiting for a
       `GET /train/progress` read to discover it. Reuses the same
       `_material_flags`/`_stamp_pool_eligibility` pair `get_progress`
       already calls; stamp-if-null only, never an overwrite.
    2. D-11: `expire_stale_sessions` closes out a stale open session before
       anything else runs.
    3. D-12: if an open session still exists after expiry, RESUME it
       (`load_session_puzzles`) rather than composing a new one — this is the
       only path taken on a second call inside an open session's window,
       including an ad-hoc "train now" request from a future phase that hits
       this same endpoint. EXCEPTION (191-06 UAT bug fix,
       `_discard_if_untouched_and_resized`): an open session with ZERO
       recorded solves whose frozen `puzzle_count` no longer matches the
       CURRENT `puzzles_per_session` is discarded instead, falling through to
       fresh composition below — this is what lets a same-day settings edit
       actually take effect before the first puzzle is solved.
    3b. D-10 guard (190.1 bug fix): if a COMPLETED session's window still
       covers today (`completed_session_in_window`), return it instead of
       composing fresh — completing a session must not unlock an immediate
       replacement on reload; the next session arrives when the window rolls
       over. Phase 191's ad-hoc "train now" (SCHD-03) will need an explicit
       opt-out of this guard, not a bypass of the open-session resume above.
    4. Otherwise compose fresh: due `drill_items` (most-overdue-first) padded
       from `pool_entry_stmt` up to `sr_slots`, plus `herring_stmt` up to
       `herring_slots` (retried with `exclude_served=False` when the source
       is exhausted). Cross-backfill (Pitfall 4): if one side comes up short,
       the OTHER side fills the gap up to `n`, so a lopsided pool still
       yields a full session whenever enough total material exists.

       Quick task 260728-pgp: both SR sources are capped at
       `MAX_ITEMS_PER_GAME_PER_SESSION` per `game_id`, SESSION-WIDE, via one
       shared `per_game_counts` Counter threaded through the due loop, the
       `sr_needed` padding loop, and the herring-shortfall cross-backfill
       loop. A due item deferred by the cap is skipped for THIS session only
       and left completely untouched (`status` stays `ACTIVE`, `due_date` is
       not modified, nothing deleted) — it resurfaces `due_date`-first next
       session. The fresh-pool side's within-game choice is instead a
       seeded UNIFORM RANDOM pick (`pick_one_per_game`), never earliest-ply
       — a permanently-tracked `drill_items` row makes an earliest-ply bias
       there permanent, unlike the due side's transient ordering. A
       cap-shortened SR side still routes through the existing
       cross-backfill above rather than relaxing the cap.
    5. Reconstruct each puzzle's full FEN + arriving move via
       `fen_and_last_move_at_ply`; a puzzle whose FEN cannot be
       reconstructed is dropped rather than served broken (never
       backfilled — the slot arithmetic already ran).
    6. If nothing survives, return zero puzzles and write NO `drill_sessions`
       row. Otherwise shuffle deterministically by `(user_id, today)` (D-09:
       a red herring's position must not be inferable from ordering) and
       materialize the session header plus one pre-inserted `DrillSolve` per
       puzzle.
    7. The `DrillSession` insert (plus any new `drill_items` padding rows) is
       wrapped in a SAVEPOINT (`session.begin_nested()`). A concurrent second
       composition winning the `uq_drill_sessions_user_open` race — or

    "Still servable" now means two DIFFERENT things depending on `source`
    (Phase 192, D-05 — `drill_solves.game_id` went from `NOT NULL` +
    `CASCADE` to nullable + `SET NULL`, so a deleted game no longer deletes
    the row):

    - `SR_ITEM`: excluded from `remaining` when EITHER its `games` row OR its
      `game_flaws` row has vanished. An orphaned SR row can never be
      attempted (the game it drills is gone), so it must not block
      completion — this is the WR-02 fix's exact reasoning, extended from
      "flaw row gone" to also cover "game row gone". Bug-fix note: this
      `Game.id.isnot(None)` clause is MANDATORY, not optional.
      189-RESEARCH.md's assumption A2 (that the outer join needed no
      parallel `or_` guard here) is wrong: before this phase, a deleted game
      CASCADE-deleted the `drill_solves` row, which is what let `remaining`
      reach 0 in the first place. After `SET NULL`, an orphaned SR row
      survives forever with `solved_at IS NULL` and would pin `remaining`
      above zero, reproducing the exact stuck-session bug WR-02 fixed.
    - `RED_HERRING`: never excluded by EITHER of the two SR clauses below (an
      unsolved herring with a nulled game link is still perfectly servable off
      its `herring_pool` row, D-03, and must keep counting toward `remaining`
      until solved — the opposite of the SR-orphan treatment above). It is
      excluded by its OWN third clause when the `herring_pool` row itself does
      not resolve; see the SEED-123 bug-fix note below.

    Bug fix (SEED-123, 2026-07-28): a herring whose `herring_pool` row does not
    resolve is now excluded from `remaining`. `load_session_puzzles` has always
    skipped such a row ("drop, never serve broken"), so counting it here made it
    unservable AND unsatisfiable: `remaining` could never reach 0 and the session
    stuck on "resume" until `expires_on` passed. This is the same stuck-session
    shape as WR-02 and D-05 above, and it is reachable in normal operation, not
    just across a migration — `drill_solves.herring_pool_id` is `ON DELETE SET
    NULL`, so deleting ANY `herring_pool` row (a prune, a regeneration) orphans
    the pointer on every in-flight session that drew it. The clause tests the
    JOINED ROW (`HerringPool.id`), not `DrillSolve.herring_pool_id`, so a stale
    non-NULL id pointing at a deleted pool row is caught too. Observed in prod on
    2026-07-28: every session composed before the pool was first generated
    carried `herring_pool_id IS NULL` and was unfinishable.

    Bug fix (WR-02, pre-Phase-192): excludes SR-source rows whose backing
    `game_flaws` row has vanished under reclassification. `load_session_puzzles`
    documents this as "lazy eviction" (a delete-then-insert reclassify can
    drop the flaw row a `drill_solves` SR item points at) and simply skips
    serving such a row rather than deleting it — leaving it `solved_at IS
    NULL` forever. Before this fix, this count still treated that row as
    outstanding, so `remaining` could never reach 0 and the session got stuck
    showing "resume" indefinitely (only self-healing once `expires_on`
    passed). The LEFT OUTER JOIN mirrors `load_session_puzzles`'s own
    `existing_flaw_keys` check, keyed the same way: (user_id, game_id, ply).

    The `status = 'open'` guard makes the UPDATE a no-op on a session that's
    already completed, so re-running this after an idempotent re-submit never
    stomps a real `completed_at` with a later timestamp.

    """D-03: tick the shield/count IMMEDIATELY when a session completes,
    correctly composed with the lazy miss walk so neither path can
    double-count or skip a scheduled day.

    Both branches below route through `_judge_one_day` — the SAME shared
    primitive `tick_days`'s lazy walk uses — so this function derives NO
    shield or count value of its own; a divergence gate greps for exactly
    one shield-credit clamp occurrence in the whole `app/` tree, in
    `app/services/train_scheduler.py`.

    Order of operations, all sequential awaits on this ONE `AsyncSession`
    (CLAUDE.md — never `asyncio.gather`):

    1. Resolve `session_date` scoped by `(id, user_id)` together (T-193-07
       IDOR guard) — a foreign or invented `session_id` resolves to nothing
       and this function returns without writing.
    2. `get_or_create_settings` + `local_today` for the current settings row.
    3. `settle_streak_snapshot` FIRST — the lazy walk runs before the
       completion is applied, so every scheduled day whose window has
       already closed is judged before this write, and a completion on a
       later day can never let an earlier missed scheduled day escape
       judgement (RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2). `session_window(today, mask)` is
       strictly after `today`, so today's own scheduled day is never judged
       by this walk — there is no conflict between the two paths on the
       current day.
    4. Choose exactly ONE `DayOutcome` from the POST-settle snapshot
       (`view.settled`), never a stale pre-settle one:
       `"fulfilled"` when `session_date` is scheduled AND
       (`settled_through` is None OR `session_date > settled_through`);
       otherwise `"credit_only"` — an off-day session (D-07) or a late
       completion of an already-frozen day (RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2, Phase 191
       D-18). `"credit_only"` returns `streak_count`/`settled_through`
       unchanged by construction, so the two branches differ ONLY in which
       discriminant is passed.
    5. Persist the already-bounded integers `_judge_one_day` returned — never
       a SQL-side `shield_level + 1` expression, which would bypass the cap
       and could violate `ck_train_settings_shield_level`. The fulfilled
       write keeps the same compare-and-set guard `settle_streak_snapshot`
       uses (so a concurrent settler cannot be overwritten with an older
       boundary); the credit-only write needs no boundary guard because it
       never moves the boundary.

    D-08 needs no code here: only `status='completed'` sessions ever reach
    this function (the caller gates on the claim that just completed the
    session), so a started-and-abandoned session is judged by the lazy walk
    as a plain missed scheduled day, never by this eager path.

    1. Resolve the `drill_solves` row by `(session_id, position)`, scoped by
       `user_id` in the WHERE clause (T-189-16 / IDOR guard) — a foreign or
       invented `session_id` resolves to nothing, so this returns None and
       the router raises 404.
    2. Compute `correct_guess` server-side from the LIVE blob
       (`_classify_and_certify_solve`) — the client can never assert either
       verdict it does not own (P-02). Phase 211 (D-03/D-07): the SAME blob
       read also certifies the vetted "also fine" set; when `played_move`
       matches a vetted entry, the server recomputes `move_quality` from its
       own stored evals and DISCARDS the client's asserted tier (the
       key-move override — `move_quality` joins `correct_guess` on the list
       of verdicts the client does not own). Off-key moves keep the client's
       assertion unchanged (D-04's accepted residual).
    3. Claim the row with a conditional UPDATE carrying `solved_at IS NULL`
       in its WHERE clause. This is the WHOLE concurrency guarantee
       (T-189-19): under READ COMMITTED, a second concurrent UPDATE blocks on
       the row lock, then re-evaluates its WHERE clause against the first
       transaction's now-committed row once unblocked — so at most one
       transaction ever claims a zero-to-nonzero `solved_at` transition.
       When the claim affects zero rows, the puzzle was already recorded:
       re-read the stored outcome and skip `apply_result` entirely — no
       second ladder advance.
    4. For an SR-source row ONLY, advance `drill_items` via `apply_result`
       (`_advance_drill_item` on a win, `_read_drill_item_state` on a loss —
       either way returning the CURRENT state, never a stale pre-solve one).
       A red-herring row touches no `drill_items` row (POOL-08).
    5. Recompute session completion (`_mark_session_complete_if_done`) after
       every call, win or lose — idempotent via the `status = 'open'` guard.
    6. D-03 (Plan 02): when THIS call's claim (`solved_at IS NULL` -> now
       set) is what just completed the session, call
       `_apply_completion_tick` inside the SAME transaction — a rollback can
       never leave a half-applied tick. Gated on `claimed AND
       session_complete`, not `session_complete` alone: a lost-claim
       re-submit of an already-solved final puzzle also sees
       `session_complete=True` but must not apply a second tick.

        guess: The user's pre-attempt "critical vs several fine" guess.
        played_move: The move the user actually played (UCI).

            a tier). Phase 211 (D-07): for a key move this assertion is
            DISCARDED in favor of the server's own tier — see step 2 above.
            `correct_move` — what feeds `apply_result` and the SR ladder — is
            derived from the post-override `effective_quality` as
            `!= "wrong"`, keeping the ladder's pass/fail semantics
            byte-identical to pre-SEED-119 for off-key moves (an inaccuracy

    never sent over the wire — because a server-stored Stockfish eval and the
    client's own WASM search are not guaranteed to agree bit-for-bit
    (project_eval_nondeterminism), and this endpoint must never be a second,
    contradicting source of truth for a number the reveal panel displays.

    # (D-10), so a RED_HERRING row's `game_id` routinely points at ANOTHER
    # user's game — 453 of 499 served herrings in prod. D-06 read the
    # resulting None as "silently degrading" a live game row and widened the
    # lookup to `game.user_id`; that was backwards. The solving user never
    # played that move, so labelling it "Played in game" in their reveal
    # states something false (observed: a herring from another user's game
    # rendered the reveal card "Best move / Played in game: a3"). A move is
    # only "played in game" when the solving user owns the source game, so
    # the ownership test is an explicit gate here rather than an implicit
    # empty-result from the row filter — the intent has to survive the next
