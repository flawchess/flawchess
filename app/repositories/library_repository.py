"""Library (Games-surface) repository — Phase 106 (SEED-036, LIBG-08/09).

Phase 108 D-02 migration: the window-scan EXISTS flaw filter is replaced by a
direct `game_flaws` table lookup. The shared predicate builder
`build_flaw_filter_clauses` produces the family-aware WHERE clauses (OR within
family, AND across families per SEED-038); `flaw_exists_from_table` wraps them
in a correlated EXISTS for the Games tab. The same predicate builder is reused
by the Flaws SELECT path (Plan 108-05) so cross-tab filter unification is
enforced in code, not convention.

All user input crosses into SQL via bound parameters (user_id, severity, tag
values from `_SEVERITY_INT` / `_TEMPO_INT` dict lookups); no f-string
interpolation of user input (T-108-06).

# Phase 129 Plan 04 — tactic motif family → int mapping (10-family taxonomy, G-01).
# Maps each family key to the TacticMotifInt values belonging to that family.
# These 10 keys are the cross-stack contract mirrored string-for-string by the
# frontend TacticFamily union (plan 129-05).
#
# Taxonomy decisions (129-UAT RESOLVED DECISIONS):
# - Each Tier-2 real-geometry motif is its own standalone family (no more merged
#   pin_skewer or discovery buckets).
# - The old "combinations" family (DEFLECTION..SACRIFICE, ints 9-17) is dropped
#   entirely — those motif ints belong to no family and are excluded from every
#   family chip/grid/EXISTS expansion. Existing game_flaws rows that carry those
#   ints are unaffected in the DB; they simply stop appearing on family surfaces.
# - The "x_ray" family is standalone (previously merged with pin/skewer).
# - "discovered_check" (int 25) and "trapped_piece" (int 26) are now first-class
#   families. The trapped_piece detector is currently suppressed in the tagger,
#   so that chip will typically be empty — tracked separately, not a bug.
# - "mate" int set is UNCHANGED (ints 7-8, 18-24); _depth_ok reads this key.
# - Move-type motifs (EN_PASSANT=27, PROMOTION=28, UNDER_PROMOTION=29) are never
#   present here (chip surfacing is out of scope, per D-09).
#
# No DB migration and no data backfill required: game_flaws stores raw motif INTs
# (SmallInteger); families are a query-time grouping only. Re-mapping family→ints
# re-groups existing rows automatically.

# Imported by apply_game_filters() (query_utils.py) via lazy import to avoid

    EVAL_COVERAGE_MIN, grouped by game_id). That GROUP BY / HAVING full-scanned the

    eval-drain (prod finding 2026-06-17).

    That coverage formula was already materialized by the eval-drain into
    games.full_evals_completed_at, so we can replace the cold-page partition scan with
    a single indexed games lookup. This is strictly cheaper (PK index, no aggregate)

    260615-rb1) still over-excluded short fully-analyzed games whose terminal position
    had no eval, causing ~0.17% divergence. full_evals_completed_at is set by the drain

    zero qualifying tactic flaws contribute a zero-count row.
    Phase 128 D-09: orientation selects the column set (allowed/missed) for both the
    LEFT JOIN gate and the COUNT FILTER predicates.

    SEED-062: orientation drives ONLY the COUNT column set; tactic_filter_orientation
    drives the tactic_families narrowing of the base game population. The comparison
    grid shows both orientations, so the service passes tactic_filter_orientation=
    "either" for both the missed and allowed fetches — both bullet populations then
    share one basis (games with a family-X tactic in either column) and match the
    gate's analyzed_n denominator, instead of inheriting the "allowed"-only default.

    Returns one row per game_id with 20 COUNT columns (10 families × player/opp).
    Python aggregates mean + CI per family in the service layer.

    Uses is_opponent_expr from query_utils — never inline ply % 2 (CONTEXT D-01, Pitfall 3).
