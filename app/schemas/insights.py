"""Pydantic v2 schemas for the endgame findings pipeline (Phase 63).

Defined per FIND-01 / FIND-05 — the schema is the contract consumed by
`insights_service.compute_findings` (Plan 04) and by the Phase 65 LLM endpoint's
prompt-assembly. Field names are LOCKED once this ships: renaming after
Phase 65 forces a prompt revision.

Re-exports `Zone`, `Trend`, `SampleQuality`, `Window`, `MetricId`, and
`SubsectionId` from `app.services.endgame_zones` so consumers only need one
import path. Plan 01 owns those type aliases; this module does not redefine
them.

Field declaration order matters for `findings_hash` determinism (FIND-05):
Pydantic v2's `model_dump_json` emits fields in declaration order, and the
service re-serialises with `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)` for cross-session
stability (see Plan 04 / RESEARCH.md §Hash Implementation).

class FilterContext(BaseModel):
    """User's active dashboard filter state, forwarded to `compute_findings`.

    Mirrors the endgame router's query-parameter surface. Three caveats:

    1. ``color`` is carried here for filter-faithfulness but is NOT forwarded
       to ``endgame_service.get_endgame_overview`` (which has no color filter).
       Per INS-03, ``color`` is also NOT fed into the LLM prompt — Phase 65
       treats it as context-only. Plan 63-03 defines the schema; wiring is a
       Plan 63-04 concern (the service must drop ``color`` before calling
       the endgame service).

    2. ``rated_only`` is included for filter-faithfulness and IS forwarded
       to the endgame service (as the ``rated`` parameter). Per INS-03 it is
       not fed into the LLM prompt.

    3. ``opponent_type`` is hardcoded to ``"human"`` inside
       ``compute_findings``; Phase 63 does not expose bot-filter findings.

    4. ``recency`` is the user's dashboard recency filter — SEPARATE from the
       two internal windows (``all_time``, ``last_3mo``) that
       ``compute_findings`` always produces (RESEARCH.md §Pitfall 4).

    Empty-window convention: when a subsection has zero qualifying games for

    ``null`` by Pydantic v2), ``zone="typical"``, ``trend="n_a"``,
    ``sample_size=0``, ``sample_quality="thin"``,
    ``is_headline_eligible=False``. Phase 65 prompt-assembly skips findings
    where ``sample_quality == "thin"`` AND ``value`` is null.

    ``dimension`` carries per-combo or per-bucket identity (e.g.
    ``{"platform": "chess.com", "time_control": "blitz"}`` for
    ``endgame_elo_timeline``, ``{"bucket": "conversion"}`` for
    ``endgame_metrics`` bucketed rows). Keeping combo identity in a dedicated

    Field declaration order is load-bearing for ``findings_hash`` stability
