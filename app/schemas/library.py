"""Library (Games-surface) schemas — Phase 106 (SEED-036, LIBG-08).

The card payload for the Games subtab: a paginated archive where each game
carries its per-game B/M/I severity counts plus a curated, deduped set of
tag-chips, and an explicit analysis-state so chess.com / unanalyzed-lichess
games surface "no engine analysis" rather than a false 0/0/0 (LIBG-02).

GameFlawCard mirrors GameRecord's fields (so the front-end reuses the same
game-card shape) and never includes any *_hash field (V5 information
disclosure — API responses expose FEN/usernames only, never internal hashes).

Phase 108 Plan 05: FlawListItem + LibraryFlawsResponse for GET /library/flaws.
Per-flaw flat list (one row per flawed position), ordered recent-first
(g.played_at DESC, f.ply), paginated (page size 20 per D-08). Never exposes
internal *_hash columns (CLAUDE.md V5).
