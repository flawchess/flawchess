    porting the formula server-side was considered and rejected (see

    `weekday_mask == 0` ("train anytime" has no denominator to show);
    otherwise it is the popcount of the scheduled-day mask (no special-
    casing — nothing gates on this value any more).
    `mastered_count`/`parked_count` are computed on the fly from
    `drill_items` (D-05, unaffected by the tick snapshot — only the
    streak/shield portion is persisted).

    `waiting_count`/`pool_state`/`next_due_date` are the server-side signals
    the nav badge and the two PROG-05 empty states need: `waiting_count` is
    an upper-bound estimate of puzzles waiting right now (never a promise of
    exact session size — see
    `app.repositories.train_repository.get_waiting_puzzle_count`).
    `pool_state` is the single discriminant the client branches on for the
    empty states: `"no_material"` means the user has never had any
    qualifying material (cold start); `"exhausted"` means material existed
    but nothing is waiting and nothing is still analyzing; `"available"`
    covers every other case, including a zero-`drill_items` user whose own
    blunders are still being analyzed (that is "catching up", not a cold
    start). `next_due_date` is the earliest date an ACTIVE item will next
    resurface, or null when nothing will (the "All caught up!" empty state's
    date).

    `streak_reset_notice` (was `streak_lost_last_week`) is derived from the
    RESULTING state (never from "did this call settle the reset"), so it
    survives a page reload and self-clears once the user trains again.

    `badge_visible` (Plan 02, D-09/D-10) is a DISPLAY HINT ONLY — it gates no
    server-side authorization, and the number the nav badge shows still
    comes from `waiting_count`. True when `waiting_count > 0` AND (today is
    a scheduled day per the user's `weekday_mask` OR an already-open
    unexpired session still has unsolved puzzles left to rescue). The client
    performs no day-of-week or timezone math of its own — it has no
    `weekday_mask` and no clean way to reproduce `local_today`, so this
    field is the single source of truth for whether the badge should show.
