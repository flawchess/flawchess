"""ORM model for drill_solves — a frozen, pre-materialized per-puzzle row (Phase 189).

Phase 189 Plan 01 (POOL-07/POOL-08, D-09/P-07). One row per puzzle selected at
session-composition time, inserted immediately with `solved_at = NULL` (P-07:
pre-materialized, not insert-on-attempt). This is what makes D-09's "frozen
list, stable '4 of 12' progress across a resumed mid-window session" cheap:
"remaining" is `WHERE session_id = ? AND solved_at IS NULL`, no re-derivation
of the original composition needed. The solve endpoint becomes an UPDATE, not
an INSERT.

Phase 192 Plan 02 (D-05, the phase's one-way door): `game_id` is now
`ON DELETE SET NULL`, NOT `CASCADE` as originally shipped in Phase 189. With
a GLOBAL herring pool (Phase 192), a *foreign* user deleting one of their own
games must never delete a row out of a STRANGER's in-flight session —
`drill_solves` rows ARE the session's frozen puzzle list (PK `(session_id,
position)`), so a CASCADE-delete here would punch a hole in the position
sequence and shift the session-score denominator for a user who did nothing.
Only a global pool (shared across users) can produce this failure mode; the
pre-Phase-192 CASCADE was correct when every herring/SR item was necessarily
the solving user's own game.

The row now survives its source game's deletion with `game_id` NULL instead
of being deleted. "Still servable" after that now means two DIFFERENT things
depending on `source` (see `app.repositories.train_repository`'s
`load_session_puzzles` / `_mark_session_complete_if_done` / `reveal_for_puzzle`
docstrings for the full branch semantics):
- A `RED_HERRING` row stays servable — its FEN/arriving move live on the
  `herring_pool` row (D-03), self-sufficient regardless of the game link.
- An `SR_ITEM` row becomes unservable (its answer key was the game's own
  PGN) and is lazily evicted — the pre-D-05 CASCADE behavior for SR items is
  preserved exactly, just via an application-level exclusion instead of a
  deleted row.

`uq_drill_solves_session_puzzle` (`session_id`, `game_id`, `ply`) no longer
protects a row whose `game_id` has nulled out — PostgreSQL treats NULLs as
distinct in a unique constraint, so two nulled rows in the same session would
not collide on this index. This is acceptable and deliberate: the
constraint's real job is to stop *composition* from inserting the same
position twice, and at composition time every row still has a non-NULL
`game_id` (composition additionally drops an own-game herring colliding with
an SR pick, Plan 01 D-10). Do NOT add a partial unique index on
`herring_pool_id` "for safety" — it would forbid the exhaustion fallback
(`herring_stmt(..., exclude_served=False)`) from ever re-serving a pool row
in a later session.

Per D-01, this table stores NO answer-key snapshot: `correct_move`/
`correct_guess`/`played_move` are the RECORDED OUTCOME of an attempt (written
by POST /train/sessions/{id}/solve, Plan 05), never a cached copy of
`best_move`/`pv`/the sharp-soft classification itself.

Phase 192 (D-04): `herring_pool_id` is the herring's authoritative no-repeat
key. Once `drill_solves.game_id`/`ply` can no longer be trusted as a stable
identity for a herring puzzle (the source game link is nullable, D-01/D-05),
`(game_id, ply)` is no longer usable for that purpose — the no-repeat
exclusion in `herring_stmt` keys on `herring_pool_id` instead. NULL for every
pre-Phase-192 row and every SR row (a herring's `herring_pool_id` is the only
non-NULL case).

Phase 206 (D-10/D-17): a third `DrillSource` member, `SHARP_FILLER`, backs a
static committed CC0 lichess puzzle set (`app.services.sharp_filler`) rather
than a table. `sharp_puzzle_id` is non-None only for a `SHARP_FILLER` row —
`game_id` and `herring_pool_id` both stay NULL for it, mirroring how
`herring_pool_id` is non-None only for a `RED_HERRING` row.
