"""ORM model for drill_sessions — a materialized Train session header (Phase 189).

Phase 189 Plan 01 (POOL-07, D-04/D-09/D-10/D-12). One row per composed
session: `status` tracks the D-09/D-10/D-11 lifecycle (open -> completed, or
open -> expired on the arrival of the next scheduled session day), and
`expires_on` implements D-10's "open until the next scheduled session day
starts" window (computed via `app.services.train_scheduler.session_window`).

Deletion semantics (D-04, LOCKED — do not "fix" this to FK `games`):
  `drill_sessions` FKs ONLY to `users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` — there is no
  `game_id` column and no cascade from any game-scoped delete. Session
  dates/scores are user progress (the Phase 191 weekly-streak source), not
  game-derived data, and are meant to SURVIVE a game wipe (delete-all +
  re-import, or the guest-prune job). This directly diverges from how
  `drill_items`/`drill_solves` anchor to `games` — that divergence is
  intentional, not an inconsistency to reconcile.
