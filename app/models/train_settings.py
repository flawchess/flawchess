"""ORM model for train_settings table (Phase 189).

Phase 189 Plan 01 (POOL-04, D-06/D-07/D-08). One settings row per user
controlling the Train schedule: the D-06 IANA timezone string used for every
"session day" boundary computation (`app.services.train_scheduler.local_today`),
the D-07 weekday bitmask (0 = empty set = "train anytime", the identity case
for `next_scheduled_day`), and the D-08 puzzles-per-session count.

Mirrors `app/models/user_import_settings.py`'s create-on-first-touch shape
exactly: PK = `user_id`, no migration-time backfill for new users, defaults
(`app.services.train_scheduler.DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` /
`DEFAULT_WEEKDAY_MASK` / `DEFAULT_PUZZLES_PER_SESSION`) applied at the
application layer on first GET/PUT via
`app.repositories.train_repository.get_or_create_settings`.

Phase 193 (SEED-121) replaced Phase 191's D-18 weekly settled-streak
snapshot (`flame_state`) with a per-scheduled-day tick + a 0-7 depletable
shield: `streak_count` (KEPT, re-meaning "completed scheduled-day sessions"
rather than "settled weeks"), `shield_level` (NEW, replaces `flame_state`),
`streak_settled_through` (KEPT, re-meaning "the last judged day" rather than
"the Monday of the last settled week"), and `pool_eligible_since` (NEW, the
D-06 eligibility watermark — never judge a scheduled day earlier than the
date the user first had qualifying material). A settled day is frozen
forever — `GET /train/progress` only ever walks days strictly after
`streak_settled_through`, so a later `weekday_mask`/`timezone` change can
never re-judge a day that already settled. See
`app.services.train_scheduler.tick_days` for the pure tick logic and
`app.repositories.train_repository.settle_streak_snapshot` for the single
mutation entry point (shared by `GET /train/progress` and
`PUT /train/settings`).
