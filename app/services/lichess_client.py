    Streams NDJSON from the lichess API line-by-line using httpx streaming,
    so large exports never need to be buffered in memory. Retries on transient
    connection drops and 5xx/429 responses — already-imported games are
    deduplicated downstream by bulk_insert_games.

    Args:
        client: Shared httpx.AsyncClient instance.
        username: The lichess username to fetch games for.
        user_id: Internal database user ID (denormalized into each game dict).
        since_ms: If provided, only games created at or after this Unix millisecond
            timestamp are returned (lichess ``since`` parameter).
        until_ms: If provided, only games played at or before this Unix millisecond
            timestamp are returned (lichess ``until`` parameter). Phase 186 Plan 02
            (IMPORT-03, D-06): used by the backward-fetch backlog walk. Purely
            additive to the existing streaming/retry loop — lichess defaults to
            ``sort=dateDesc`` (newest-first), so combined with ``max_games`` the
            LAST game yielded in a bounded call is the OLDEST one in that chunk;
            its ``played_at`` becomes the next ``until_ms`` cursor for the caller's
            next backward-walk iteration.
        max_games: If provided, caps the number of games lichess returns
            (server-side ``max`` parameter). Used by benchmark ingest to truncate
            per-(user, TC) volume, and by the backward-walk to bound each chunk;
            forward/incremental user-facing imports leave this ``None``.
        perf_type: If provided, restricts results to one or more comma-separated
            perfTypes (``bullet``/``blitz``/``rapid``/``classical``/``correspondence``/...).
            Opt-in because this filter silently truncates: e.g. a bare
            ``perfType=classical`` excludes correspondence, chess960, and imported
            (fromPosition) games server-side (D-14). Benchmark ingest and the
            backward-walk want that server-side truncation as a bandwidth
            optimization; forward/incremental user-facing imports leave this
            ``None`` and rely solely on the post-fetch TC filter (D-02).
        on_game_fetched: Optional callback called once per yielded game.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``username`` is not found on lichess (HTTP 404).
        RuntimeError: If lichess returns persistent failure (5xx after retries,
            429 after retries, or unexpected non-200 such as 401/403). Raising
            halts the import so the job is marked ``failed`` and ``last_synced_at``
            is preserved — preventing silent data loss when an error body would
            otherwise be parsed as "0 games" and the cursor advanced. See
            ``.planning/debug/prod-import-missed-games.md`` for the chess.com
