    Streams NDJSON from the lichess API line-by-line using httpx streaming,
    so large exports never need to be buffered in memory. Retries on transient
    connection drops and 5xx/429 responses — already-imported games are
    deduplicated downstream by bulk_insert_games.

    Args:
        client: Shared httpx.AsyncClient instance.
        username: The lichess username to fetch games for.
        user_id: Internal database user ID (denormalized into each game dict).
        since_ms: If provided, only games created at or after this Unix millisecond
            timestamp are returned (lichess ``since`` parameter).
        max_games: If provided, caps the number of games lichess returns
            (server-side ``max`` parameter). Used by benchmark ingest to truncate
            per-(user, TC) volume; user-facing imports leave this ``None``.
        perf_type: If provided, restricts results to one perfType
            (``bullet``/``blitz``/``rapid``/``classical``/...). Opt-in because
            this filter silently truncates: it excludes correspondence, chess960,
            and imported (fromPosition) games server-side. Benchmark ingest wants
            exactly that behavior; user-facing imports leave this ``None``.
        on_game_fetched: Optional callback called once per yielded game.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``username`` is not found on lichess (HTTP 404).
        RuntimeError: If lichess returns persistent failure (5xx after retries,
            429 after retries, or unexpected non-200 such as 401/403). Raising
            halts the import so the job is marked ``failed`` and ``last_synced_at``
            is preserved — preventing silent data loss when an error body would
            otherwise be parsed as "0 games" and the cursor advanced. See
