"""Pure interval-ladder scheduler for Train (Phase 189).

No I/O, no DB, stdlib only. Every function here is a pure transform over
plain `datetime.date`/`int`/`bool` values — no SQLAlchemy, no session, no
network. Fully unit-testable in isolation; see
tests/services/test_train_scheduler.py.

Phase 189 Plan 01 adds the constants and the two day-boundary functions
(`local_today`, `next_scheduled_day`). Plan 01 Task 2 adds the ladder
transition (`apply_result`), the session window (`session_window`), and the
expiry predicate (`is_session_expired`).

Day-boundary convention (D-06, LOCKED): `local_today` is THE ONE conversion
site from a UTC instant to a user's local calendar day, via the stored IANA
timezone string on `train_settings`. Every other Train day computation
(due-date snapping, session windows, the streak tick machine) reuses this
and never re-derives `.date()` from a naive UTC datetime elsewhere.

Phase 193 (SEED-121) replaces Phase 191's weekly `FlameState`/`settle_weeks`
settlement machine with a per-scheduled-day tick + a 0-7 depletable
`shield_level` (`TickSnapshot`/`TickView`/`tick_days`). See that phase's
CONTEXT.md/RESEARCH.md for the full design rationale; the short version:
a completed scheduled-day session ticks the shield/count up (capped at
`SHIELD_CAP`), a missed scheduled day drains the shield by one (floored at
0, resetting the count when the shield empties), and a scheduled day before
the user ever had trainable material is neutral (D-05/D-06).

SEED-154 makes `apply_result`'s `fail_count` a LIFETIME lapse counter instead
of one that resets on every correct solve. Before this change, an item
alternately solved and failed could never leave the Train pool: `MASTERED`
needs 3 *consecutive* correct solves (alternation caps the streak at 1
forever) and the only park door (`PARK_FAIL_THRESHOLD`) required
`ever_correct is False`, which the first correct solve permanently
disqualified. `apply_result` now has two independent park doors: Door A
(unchanged, never-solved + 3 lifetime lapses) and Door B (new, 6 lifetime
lapses regardless of `ever_correct`) — see `LEECH_FAIL_THRESHOLD`.

        outcome:
            - `"neutral"`: the day is before the user ever had trainable
              material (D-05/D-06). Advances `settled_through` only.
            - `"fulfilled"`: a completed session on this scheduled day.
              Advances `streak_count` (+1), `shield_level` (+1, capped at
              `SHIELD_CAP`), and `settled_through`.
            - `"missed"`: no completed session on this scheduled day.
              `shield_level` drops by 1 (floored at 0); `streak_count`
              resets to 0 exactly when the shield reaches 0, otherwise stays
              frozen. Advances `settled_through`.
            - `"credit_only"`: an ad-hoc off-day completion or a late
              completion of an already-frozen day. Raises `shield_level`
              only (same cap), leaving `streak_count` AND `settled_through`
              untouched.

    Returns:
        The advanced `TickSnapshot`.

    """Advance the tick snapshot over every scheduled day whose window has
    closed (PROG-01).

    Args:
        snapshot: The persisted `TickSnapshot` before this call (the
            all-zero/all-null `TickSnapshot(0, 0, None)` for a brand-new
            row — this is what triggers a full-history replay on the first
            call, same mechanism Phase 191 used for D-05 retroactivity).
        completed_session_dates: Every `drill_sessions.session_date` with
            `status='completed'` for this user (already tz-resolved plain
            local dates, never re-converted). Order-insensitive.
        weekday_mask: The user's CURRENT scheduled-day bitmask. Only ever
            applied to days strictly after `snapshot.settled_through` (a
            settled day is frozen forever) and to newly-walked days.
        today: The local calendar day (from `local_today`).
        pool_eligible_since: The D-06 eligibility watermark. `None` means
            the user has never had qualifying material — every day judged
            (if any) resolves NEUTRAL. A scheduled day strictly before this
            watermark is also NEUTRAL; on/after it, the day is judged
            fulfilled/missed normally.

    Returns:
        A `TickView` with the advanced (or unchanged) snapshot, the
        display-only current-week count, and the reset notice.

    The elapsed-day boundary is `is_session_expired(session_window(day,
    weekday_mask), today)` — NEVER a bare `day < today` comparison. Under a
    sparse mask this is a real generalization (a Monday scheduled day under
    a Mon/Wed/Fri mask is not judged on Tuesday, only from Wednesday); under
    a dense mask (`weekday_mask in (0, ALL_WEEKDAYS_MASK)`) `session_window`
    collapses to `day + 1`, so this is identical to the naive boundary for
    the default user — a strict superset of correctness, not a behavior
    change for the common case.

    A settled day is frozen forever: this walk only ever starts strictly
    after `snapshot.settled_through`, so a later `weekday_mask` or timezone
    change can never re-judge a day that already settled.
