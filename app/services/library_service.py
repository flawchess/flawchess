"""Library (Games-surface) service — Phase 106 (SEED-036, LIBG-08).

Phase 108 D-02 migration: GET /library/games and GET /library/flaw-stats now
read M+B flaws from `game_flaws` instead of re-calling the Phase 105 kernel
per query. The per-game N+1 `_load_analyzed_flaws` loop is retired.

Games card chips (curated/deduped M+B tags) and per-game M+B severity counts
come from a single batched `game_flaws` read for the whole page. Inaccuracy
counts come from the oracle columns (games.white_/black_inaccuracies) — never
from game_flaws (D-03). Analysis state ("no engine analysis") is determined by
the eval-coverage gate on game_positions (not by game_flaws row presence).

Flaw-stats severity counts, tag distribution, and trend come from a single
game_flaws JOIN games scan. The analyzed_n/total_n denominator stays on the
eval-coverage gate (game_positions) — a game analyzed with zero M+B flaws still
counts toward analyzed_n (Pitfall 6/RESEARCH §7).

Chip curation (SEED-036): aggregate tags to the game level across all game_flaws
rows, drop any phase tag (opening/middlegame/endgame), emit one chip per
remaining tag type (game-level dedupe), in a deterministic order.

    (analysis_state), and fetch_page_eval_positions (eval chart data). This
    eliminates the per-game classify_game_flaws kernel re-call.

    Inaccuracy count comes from the oracle columns (games.white_/black_inaccuracies)
    — never from game_flaws (D-03). NULL oracle values default to 0.

    "No engine analysis" state is gated on the eval-coverage check (is_analyzed),
    NOT on game_flaws row count — an analyzed game with zero M+B flaws still
    returns analysis_state="analyzed" (LIBG-02).

    Phase 109 (LIBG-10): when is_analyzed and positions are provided, the three
    new eval chart fields (eval_series, flaw_markers, phase_transitions) are

    when positions are provided for an unanalyzed game (single-game path only),
    moves and phase_transitions ARE populated — they derive from move_san/phase
    on game_positions, not from evals, so an unanalyzed game can still render a
    navigable board.

    Quick 260702-mnd: the card now surfaces every valid tactic slot regardless of
    the active tactic/severity filter — a selected card is a complete picture of
    that game's flaws, consistent with the context chips (which already ignore
    every filter, see _curate_chips_from_rows). Game SELECTION (which games
    appear at all) is still enforced upstream by query_filtered_games; this
    function only decides which tags render on an already-selected card. The two

    not already decisively lost for the mover, and (2) the confidence floor
    (_TACTIC_CHIP_CONFIDENCE_MIN, inside tactic_slot_visible). Both gate
    correctness/noise, not filter membership.

    Quick 260628-u7d: tactic_flaw_rows is a both-color (ungated) row list used

    include opponent rows. When None, falls back to flaw_rows so any other caller
