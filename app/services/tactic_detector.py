"""Tactic-motif detector for Phase 124 (TACDET-01/02/03/04).

Pure Python/CPU transform over a stored Stockfish refutation PV.
No I/O, no DB, no Stockfish calls. Input: board_after_flaw (chess.Board)
+ pv_str (space-joined UCI from game_positions.pv). Output: (motif, piece, confidence, depth).

Encoding follows the EndgameClassInt precedent (endgame_service.py:108):
  TacticMotifInt — IntEnum encoding for the tactic_motif SmallInteger column.
  TacticMotif    — Literal type alias for human-readable motif strings.
  _INT_TO_MOTIF / _MOTIF_TO_INT — bidirectional dicts.

Detector function return convention (used by dispatcher in detect_tactic_motif):
  Phase 127 contract (D-05):
  Core 8 + named-mate detectors: (fired: bool, piece: int | None, depth: int | None)
    depth is the half-move loop index at the point the motif fires (raw ply from flaw_ply+1).
    piece follows D-12 per-motif semantics.
  Tier-3 detectors: (fired: bool, piece: int | None, confidence: int, depth: int | None)
    confidence is 0-100 graded (count-of-conditions / total * 100).
    depth is the half-move loop index when the motif fires.
  detect_boden_or_double_bishop_mate: (motif: TacticMotif | None, piece: int | None, depth: int | None)
  Dispatcher detect_tactic_motif: (motif_int, piece, confidence, depth) — 4-tuple throughout.
  Graded scoring: _grade(met, total) -> int is the single named helper.

Relevance gate (D-01): non-mate detectors that scan the full PV check that the motif
fires in a continuation where pov does not lose material vs the starting position, or
fires on the very first pov move. This eliminates Case-B incidental hits (motif visible
in a non-forcing continuation after the refutation already won) without killing real
deep combinations (Case A — a forcing line where the motif IS the point).

    copy from cook.py/util.py). Reuses _is_in_bad_spot and _piece_value (the
    existing faithful cook ports at L318 and L270).

    All of the following must hold:
    1. The board is NOT in check and the piece is NOT pinned (immobility from
       check/pin is a different motif, excluded here).
    2. The piece is not a pawn and not a king (only N/B/R/Q can be trapped).
    3. The piece is currently in a bad spot (_is_in_bad_spot: attacked AND either
       hanging or capturable by a strictly-lower-value non-king attacker).
    4. For every legal move of that piece:
       a. If the escape captures an opponent (pov) piece worth >= the trapped
          piece's own value → NOT trapped (trade-up/equal escape).
       b. Push the escape and check: if the piece is NOT in a bad spot on the
          new square → NOT trapped (safe square found).
    5. If no escape avoided a bad spot and none captured equal/greater → trapped.

    Bug fix (Phase 221 TAGFIX-05 fix 3, D-12): the piece with an EMPTY escape set
    (fully blocked, not technically pinned but no legal escapes) now falls through
    to Gate 5 and returns True, matching cook (an immobile attacked non-pawn/
    non-king piece IS trapped). The prior "Empty-escape-set exclusion" early
    `return False` here was a precision-first deviation NOT present in cook; the
    oracle comparison (scripts/research/oracle_compare.py, review report §4)
    measured reverting it as +107 detections with ZERO new false positives. Do
    not reintroduce the exclusion as a future "precision-first" deviation.

    """Trapped piece: reimplemented from cook's trapped_piece driver + util.is_trapped
    prose (Phase 134 Plan 02; AGPL boundary — no source copy from cook.py/util.py).

    Cook's driver anchors to the SOLUTION CAPTURE CHAIN (the dominant precision fix):
    instead of scanning every opponent non-pawn piece on every board, walk pov's moves
    at even indices STARTING FROM THE SECOND pov move (k=2,4,...). For each such move
    that captures a non-pawn opponent piece on square t:
      - If the immediately preceding opponent move (moves[k-1]) also landed on t,
        the square-of-interest is moves[k-1].from_square (where the opponent piece
        came from); otherwise it is t.
      - Evaluate _piece_is_trapped on boards[k-1] (the board BEFORE the preceding
        opponent move) at the square-of-interest.
      - If trapped → fire.

    This eliminates the dominant FP source from v3: the old code scanned ALL opponent
    non-pawn pieces on every pov-result board, inventing trapped judgments on pieces

    D-06 (shared with detect_clearance): the scan stops once k exceeds
    SACRIFICE_CLEARANCE_MAX_DEPTH — a `break`, not a `continue`, since k only grows.

    Phase 221 plan 08 (gap closure, TAGFIX-03 amendment): D-05's persistence check
    (require the deficit to still hold at boards[k+3], the board after the NEXT pov
    move, or the line to end first) is RETIRED. It was added in plan 05 to drop the
    delayed-recapture / zwischenzug shape (32% of cook's own labelled sacrifice
    puzzles per the review report), but the 221-D13-SPOTCHECK.md operator review
    found it also drops GENUINE sacrifices whose material recovers because the
    sacrifice worked (rows 0064, 0133 in the committed real-game sample,
    realgame_tags.csv: Nxd6 and gxf8=Q+ are the tactic's own follow-ups, not
    unrelated recaptures). Task 1 of
    plan 08 measured, on the real-game fixture, that no board-derivable rule
    separates the two populations:
      - "recovery overshoots the entry baseline" (boards[k+3] ends up above initial,
        not merely back to even) also fires on row 0134 — confirmed NOT a real
        sacrifice (White never offers material; Black simply captures a knight then
        a rook) — a false accept.
      - "deficit depth" (how far the material swings down) does not separate them
        either: row 0134 reaches the same minimum deficit (-3) as the genuine row
        0064.
      - "the opponent chose to accept" (a quiet pov move offered material, the
        opponent's very next move captured it) matches row 0064's shape (Ndb5 offers,
        cxb5 accepts) but NOT row 0133's (both of pov's early moves in that line are
        captures, not quiet offers) — rejecting a confirmed-real row is exactly the
        failure this amendment exists to prevent.
    Distinguishing a compensated sacrifice from a delayed recapture is fundamentally
    an EVALUATION question (does the resulting position have real value, not just
    material?), and `detect_sacrifice` has no eval access by design (eval lives in
    forcing_line_gate.py, D-01) — plumbing one in is out of this plan's scope. D-01's
    own per-tier winning floor (already shipped, TAGFIX-01) independently carries the
    "is this line actually good for the solver" question at classification time: of
    the 7 real-game rows the now-retired persistence rule dropped beyond cook's own
    predicate, D-01's floor alone would have kept exactly the 3 genuine/plausible
    sacrifices (0064 +264cp, 0128 mate-in-7, 0133 +453cp) and rejected the other 4
    (three deep-losing lines plus row 0134 at 197cp, just under the +200 floor) — so
    reverting this predicate to cook's unguarded form does not reopen the
    delayed-recapture problem in practice; D-01 continues to carry it. See the
    divergence block above the `sacrifice` PRECISION_FLOOR entry in
    tests/scripts/tagger/precision_floors.py for the full measurement and the numbers.

    D-08: there is exactly one detect_sacrifice, taking no orientation parameter;
    both orientations reach it through the same dispatcher, so the depth-cap rule
    applies identically regardless of which side is pov.

    No _grade voting — cook's predicate is boolean (all conditions or nothing).
    Returns TACTIC_CONFIDENCE_HIGH when the AND-chain fires.

    Note (D-02): sacrifice is a co-tag that rarely wins single-winner dispatch (geometric
    and depth-primary motifs pre-empt it). Expected to remain suppressed post-port.

          Caveat (Phase 148 truncated-mate fallback): when `has_forced_mate=True` and
          the PV was capped before reaching mate, this is the last-displayed-ply
          approximation (len(moves)-1), not the true (unknown) mating ply — so it is
          systematically shallower than a fully-resolved mate's depth.

    Dispatch strategy (D-02): mates (Tier 1) short-circuit and always win (D-03/D-07).
    All non-mate detectors run and collect firings; the SHALLOWEST motif wins (depth primary,
    D-05); equal depth breaks by priority tier/rank so exactly one motif is returned.
    Hanging-piece (Tier 4, depth 0) beats a fork (Tier 2, depth 2) because depth dominates.
