"""Tactic-motif detector for Phase 124 (TACDET-01/02/03/04).

Pure Python/CPU transform over a stored Stockfish refutation PV.
No I/O, no DB, no Stockfish calls. Input: board_after_flaw (chess.Board)
+ pv_str (space-joined UCI from game_positions.pv). Output: (motif, piece, confidence, depth).

Encoding follows the EndgameClassInt precedent (endgame_service.py:108):
  TacticMotifInt — IntEnum encoding for the tactic_motif SmallInteger column.
  TacticMotif    — Literal type alias for human-readable motif strings.
  _INT_TO_MOTIF / _MOTIF_TO_INT — bidirectional dicts.

Detector function return convention (used by dispatcher in detect_tactic_motif):
  Phase 127 contract (D-05):
  Core 8 + named-mate detectors: (fired: bool, piece: int | None, depth: int | None)
    depth is the half-move loop index at the point the motif fires (raw ply from flaw_ply+1).
    piece follows D-12 per-motif semantics.
  Tier-3 detectors: (fired: bool, piece: int | None, confidence: int, depth: int | None)
    confidence is 0-100 graded (count-of-conditions / total * 100).
    depth is the half-move loop index when the motif fires.
  detect_boden_or_double_bishop_mate: (motif: TacticMotif | None, piece: int | None, depth: int | None)
  Dispatcher detect_tactic_motif: (motif_int, piece, confidence, depth) — 4-tuple throughout.
  Graded scoring: _grade(met, total) -> int is the single named helper.

Relevance gate (D-01): non-mate detectors that scan the full PV check that the motif
fires in a continuation where pov does not lose material vs the starting position, or
fires on the very first pov move. This eliminates Case-B incidental hits (motif visible
in a non-forcing continuation after the refutation already won) without killing real
deep combinations (Case A — a forcing line where the motif IS the point).

    Rebuilt to cook's two-sub-test port (D-09/D-10, plan 02 — no source copy):

    the pov pinner and apply both cook sub-tests:
