"""Train reminder scheduler: notification copy + the periodic tick (Phase 201).

Plan 201-01 built the notification-copy layer (`build_reminder_payload`),
consumed by the dev-only trigger endpoint (`POST /api/push/dev/trigger-reminder`,
D-17). Plan 201-04 (this addition) adds the periodic tick that fires it for
real users: `run_periodic_train_reminders` is an `asyncio.create_task` in the
FastAPI lifespan (D-15), mirroring `app.services.guest_cleanup_service`'s
shape exactly -- a named interval constant, a per-tick orchestrator
(`send_due_reminders`) that opens its own session per candidate, and a single
aggregate Sentry capture per tick.

Per-candidate step order (`_process_candidate`) is load-bearing -- see
201-04-PLAN.md's Task 2 for the full rationale:
  1. `is_scheduled_day` (REMIND-03) -- reused verbatim, never re-derived.
  2. Local-hour gate, inclusive at equality, no upper bound (D-08).
  3. A cheap `reminder_last_sent_on` pre-filter (the claim in step 5 is the
     real guard, REMIND-05).
  4. `settle_streak_snapshot`, committed as its own step, BEFORE the copy is
     built and BEFORE the claim (D-12) -- the job is a WRITER of streak
     state, not just a reader, so a lapsed user's "Day N" is honest.
  5. `has_completed_session_on` (REMIND-04/D-09), placed AFTER settlement so
     the settled state reflects a same-day completion, and BEFORE the claim
     so an already-trained user's day stays unclaimed.
  6. `claim_reminder_day`, committed BEFORE any network call (D-07) -- this
     is what makes a double-send structurally impossible across a crash
     mid-fan-out or a second ticker.
  7. `push_send.send_to_user` -- the fan-out to every live subscription
     (D-05) is already implemented there; this module calls it once per
     claimed candidate, now carrying a TTL bounded by the same
     end-of-local-day rule step 2's hour gate already relies on
     (Phase 204 D-01).
  8. (Phase 204 D-13/D-14) `train_reminder_repository.release_reminder_claim`
     -- runs ONLY when the fan-out delivered to nobody (`attempted == 0` or
     `attempted == pruned`), and ONLY as the next statement after step 7
     returns normally (never from an exception handler, so a crash
     mid-fan-out leaves the claim standing per D-07). Un-claiming the day
     lets a same-day device re-sync (Plan 01) still produce a reminder
     today rather than tomorrow.
