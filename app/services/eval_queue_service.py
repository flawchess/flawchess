"""Priority queue service for the full-ply eval drain (QUEUE-01/02/05/06/08).

Three-tier pick:
  Tier 1 (TIER_EXPLICIT)      — explicit user request
  Tier 2                      — unused (its only enqueue source was removed in
                                Phase 118; the eval_jobs.tier column and the
                                tier-agnostic claim SQL below still support it,
                                but there is no active tier-2 lane)
  Tier 3 (TIER_IDLE_BACKLOG)  — idle backlog (derived pick, no eval_jobs row)

Tier-1 uses SELECT FOR UPDATE OF … SKIP LOCKED against the eval_jobs table for
a lock-safe, serialized claim contract (QUEUE-06 / SEED-012 D-8); the claim SQL
is tier-agnostic (`ORDER BY tier ASC`) so it would transparently pick up a
future tier-2 row without changes.

Tier-3 is a *derived* pick via a SINGLE Efraimidis–Spirakis recency-weighted
lottery over candidate users. Quick 260723-j6g unified the population: a
candidate user is anyone with EITHER a needs-engine game (full_evals_completed_at
IS NULL AND lichess_evals_at IS NULL, non-guest only) OR a lichess-eval-pv-
incomplete game (full_pv_completed_at IS NULL AND lichess_evals_at IS NOT NULL,
any user incl. guests). No rows are pre-populated in eval_jobs for the backlog.
This keeps the queue table lean (~558k backlog games never pre-inserted) while
providing fast catch-up for returning users (SEED-046).

DELIBERATE PRECEDENCE CHANGE (260723-j6g, supersedes 174-07/SEED-109): prior to
this quick, the lichess-eval population ran ONLY as a residual fallback — it was
drawn only when NO needs-engine candidate existed anywhere. Verified against prod
2026-07-23: user 235's 63.5k-game needs-engine import (~5 days to drain) was
starving user 28's 3 returning lichess-eval games, because the residual lane never
got a turn while ANY needs-engine game existed for ANY user. The τ½=1d
recency-weighted user lottery exists precisely so a returning user wins a fair
share of draws against a mass importer — but the lichess-eval population never
entered that lottery. Folding it into the SAME unified Step-1/Step-2 draw fixes
this: lichess-eval games now compete on equal footing with needs-engine games,
weighted by the same recency lottery, instead of only draining when the
needs-engine backlog is globally empty. There is no more residual fallback lane.

Tier 4b (TIER_BESTMOVE_BACKFILL, Phase 176 BACK-01) is a separate spare-capacity
lottery ordered after tier-4 blob backfill in the bundled scope=None path: it
picks a PV-complete, best-move-incomplete, non-lichess-eval, non-guest game
(the engine-side sibling of the 174-07 residual fallback above) and requires
BOTH EVAL_AUTO_DRAIN_ENABLED and the dedicated BEST_MOVE_BACKFILL_ENABLED gate
(D-05) — best-move backfill is backend-only (Maia inference cannot run on the
remote worker fleet) so it needs an independent kill-switch.

Lease TTL:
  LEASE_TTL_SECONDS = 120
  Derivation: tier-1 fan-out ≈ 10s (all plies via pool, spike-003); tier-2/3
  per-worker worst case ≈ 60 plies × 0.98 s/ply ≈ 59s. 2× the slow case → 120s.

Security (RESEARCH §Security V5):
  All worker_id / TTL / τ / floor values are bound as :params — never interpolated
  into the sa.text CTE string. No f-string is used inside sa.text calls.

QUEUE-08 (guest exclusion):
  Every claim path JOINs the users table and filters NOT users.is_guest.
  enqueue_tier1_game also refuses to enqueue a guest's game (no-op).

      (NULL → coalesced to a very old timestamp so the exp term ≈ 0 and weight ≈
      floor), τ = RECENCY_HALF_LIFE_DAYS / ln(2) converted to seconds. weight is
      always > 0 (guards div-by-zero in the ES key).

    Step 2 — UNIFIED WEIGHTED GAME PICK FOR PICKED USER (D-7, unified 260723-j6g):
      Within the chosen user, pick a game via the SAME union predicate as Step 1,
      scoped to g.user_id = :picked_user — game_weight = tc_multiplier *
      (exp(-Δt_played / τ_game) + GAME_WEIGHT_FLOOR). The needs-engine branch is
      guarded by `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users u WHERE u.id = :picked_user AND
      u.is_guest = false)` so a guest's needs-engine game can NEVER be picked
      here even if Step 1 somehow picked a guest (it only can via branch (b));
      the lichess-eval branch is unguarded. tc_multiplier comes from
      GAME_TC_WEIGHTS (classical=8 > rapid=4 > blitz=2 > bullet=1 > other=0.5),
      τ_game derives from GAME_RECENCY_HALF_LIFE_DAYS, and Δt_played is seconds
      since played_at (NULL coalesced to epoch-0). This preserves D-7 (three
      workers landing on the same user usually pick different games; D-4
      residual-duplicate acceptance still stands). Both callers benefit: the
      in-process server pool and the 120-02 HTTP lease endpoint both reach this
      via claim_eval_job / direct call — no caller change needed.

      After Step 2 returns a game_id, is_lichess_eval_game is derived PER-GAME
      via a PK-indexed lookup (`select(Game.lichess_evals_at).where(Game.id ==
      game_id)`) rather than assumed from which branch "should" have matched —
      this is more robust than branch-tagging and matches how the tier-1/2 and
      tier-4b paths already resolve the flag elsewhere in this module.

      If Step 1 returns None (no candidate anywhere) → return None. If Step 2
      returns None (a race: the picked user's matching games drained between
      Step 1 and Step 2) → return None; the next tick re-draws. There is
      deliberately NO fallback lane here — reintroducing one would resurrect
      the precedence bug this quick fixes.

    This replaces the old D-118-04 last_activity DESC winner-take-all ordering and
    drops the dead lichess_evals_at tiebreaker (live prod bug: it was the LAST ORDER
    key and played_at broke ties first, so lichess games were picked at full engine
    cost despite the needs-engine predicate above saying to skip them — ~70%
    throughput waste on user 28; see RESEARCH-NOTES §Live prod bug). It further
    replaces the 174-07/SEED-109 residual-fallback precedence (lichess-eval games
    only drawn when the needs-engine backlog is globally empty) with the unified
    single-lottery precedence described above (260723-j6g).

    Guest asymmetry (QUEUE-08, Quick 260719-fsz) is preserved but now expressed
    per-branch inside the unified predicate rather than via a blanket outer
    filter: guests are eligible ONLY through the lichess-eval branch, never the
    needs-engine branch, in both Step 1 and Step 2.

    Returns (game_id, user_id, is_lichess_eval_game) or None when nothing to process.

    Note: plain SELECT with no locking — two concurrent workers can pick the same game
    (double-claim). Duplicate work is idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for flaws,
    idempotent oracle UPDATE) but wastes engine calls. D-7 only REDUCES collisions;
    the ephemeral TTL-lease escalation (D-4 "later") remains the deferred zero-
    collision endgame. Add FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED when multi-worker leasing is added.

    Security: τ_seconds, floor_val, game τ and multipliers, and :picked_user are
    all bound as :params — no f-string-interpolated VALUES anywhere (see
    _es_weighted_user_pick / _es_weighted_game_pick docstrings for the
    query-shape-vs-value distinction). The EXISTS-subquery fragments composed
    here are trusted hardcoded literals, never derived from request/user input.

    Index note (no migration needed): both branches of the unified predicate are
    already backed by existing partial indexes on games(user_id) —
    ix_games_needs_engine_full_evals (needs-engine) and
    ix_games_lichess_pv_backfill_pending (lichess-eval-pv-incomplete, 174-07) —
    so PostgreSQL can BitmapOr the two partials for Step 1's EXISTS predicate.

    """Tier-4 spare-capacity lottery: pick one analyzed non-guest game with a NULL-blob flaw.

    Two-stage Efraimidis-Spirakis (ES) weighted lottery mirroring _claim_tier3_derived's
    two-step pattern, built on the same shared _es_weighted_user_pick /
    _es_weighted_game_pick building blocks (see their docstrings for the general
    ES-key derivation; WRITE-06). Both stages run sequentially in the same session —
    no asyncio.gather (AsyncSession is not safe for concurrent coroutine use) and no
    locking, mirroring tier-3's plain-SELECT shape.

    Stage 1 — WEIGHTED USER PICK:
      Candidate users = non-guest users with at least one analyzed game
      (full_evals_completed_at IS NOT NULL) that has a NULL-blob flaw
      (game_flaws.allowed_pv_lines IS NULL). weight = exp(-Δt/τ_u) +
      TIER4_USER_WEIGHT_FLOOR, where Δt = seconds since last_activity (NULL
      coalesced to epoch-0 so the exp term ≈ 0, weight ≈ floor) and τ_u =
      TIER4_USER_RECENCY_HALF_LIFE_DAYS / ln(2) in seconds.

    Stage 2 — WEIGHTED GAME PICK FOR THE PICKED USER:
      Within the picked user, pick a NULL-blob-flaw analyzed game weighted by
      full_evals_completed_at recency AND time-control priority (longer TCs first),
      mirroring tier-3's game pick. weight =
      tc_multiplier * (exp(-Δt_evals/τ_g) + TIER4_GAME_WEIGHT_FLOOR), where
      tc_multiplier comes from GAME_TC_WEIGHTS (classical=8 > rapid=4 > blitz=2 >
      bullet=1 > other=0.5), Δt_evals = seconds since full_evals_completed_at (NULL
      cannot occur here — gated by the WHERE clause), τ_g =
      TIER4_GAME_RECENCY_HALF_LIFE_DAYS / ln(2) in seconds.

    This replaces the Phase 146 D-01 top-N recency-window CTE: that mechanism was a
    hard cutoff (game #51 by full_evals_completed_at DESC had probability zero), so an
    old analyzed corpus (e.g. user 28's ~5k games) never drained while a trickle of
    freshly-analyzed games kept refilling the window. The floor terms here give every
    pending-blob game across the whole corpus non-zero draw mass so the whole backlog
    drains, while the recency weighting keeps freshly-analyzed games dominant on most
    draws (SEED-072 fairness fix).

    Returns (game_id, user_id) or None when no backfill-eligible flaw remains (either
    stage returning no row is a None-guard fall-through, mirroring _claim_tier3_derived's
    None-guard shape).

    No eval_jobs row is created — this is a table-less, idempotent-by-construction lottery.
    Once all of a game's flaw blobs (or D-06 sentinels) are written the game stops matching
    the predicate (no flaw with allowed_pv_lines IS NULL) and is never re-selected.

    is_lichess_eval_game is NOT resolved here — it is determined later in the Plan-03 lease
    handler, which has the full game context needed to route the blob write correctly
    (RESEARCH Pitfall 6). This function returns only the (game_id, user_id) pair.

    Security: :tau_u, :floor_u, :picked_user, :tau_g, :floor_g, and the :tc_* TC
    multipliers are all bound via the sa.text params dict — never f-string-interpolated

    rather than falling in a permanent coverage hole. This does NOT reintroduce
    the D-03 contention with 174-07's residual fallback: the residual takes only

    inline server walk that used to fill blobs on the `/submit` path (`_apply_submit` now

    blob and stays NULL-blob → gets re-served indefinitely (~5:1 submit:completion waste,
    `/lease?scope=idle` never 204s, gating backfill starved). Remote workers must instead
    fall through to their dedicated rung-4 `/flaw-blob-lease` (→ `_claim_tier4_blob` →
    MultiPV-2 continuation → `/flaw-blob-submit`), the only post-146 path that writes blobs.
