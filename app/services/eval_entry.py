"""Entry-ply (import-time) cold-drain lane helpers (Phase 150 R7 / WRITE-04 Task 2).

Physically relocated from app/services/eval_drain.py (Phase 91 / SEED-023's
"lifted from import_service.py" cold-drain helpers). Completes the R7 3-way
split: eval_apply.py holds the shared write path, eval_entry.py holds the
entry-ply (depth-15, no-shift) collection/write/classify primitives, and
eval_drain.py retains full-lane orchestration (run_eval_drain, _full_drain_tick,
run_full_eval_drain, resweep_holed_games) plus the two entry-lease functions
that open their own internal DB sessions (_pick_pending_game_ids,
_load_pgns_for_games -- kept local per the note in eval_drain.py, both
consumed exclusively by run_eval_drain there).

Consumed by:
    - app/routers/eval_remote.py::entry_submit_eval (the remote-worker
      entry-submit endpoint)
    - app/services/import_service.py (hot-lane Stage 5c covered-game gate via
      _collect_midgame_eval_targets / _collect_endgame_span_eval_targets)
    - app/services/eval_drain.py::run_eval_drain (the entry-ply cold-drain
      coroutine, which imports these back -- see that module's own docstring)

None of the functions in this module open their own AsyncSession -- every
async function here takes `session: AsyncSession` as an explicit parameter
from the caller. This is a deliberate design property (not incidental): it
means moving this module carries zero risk to existing test session-patching
(`monkeypatch.setattr(<module>, "async_session_maker", ...)`) fixtures, since
there is no async_session_maker binding in this module for any test to have
needed to patch in the first place.

    Called in the cold-lane write session AFTER _apply_eval_results and BEFORE
    _mark_evals_completed — so eval_cp is committed before classification reads
    it, and flaw rows commit atomically with the eval results (Pitfall 2 guard).

    SEQUENTIAL loop — AsyncSession is not safe for concurrent use from multiple
    coroutines (CLAUDE.md hard rule). The drain batch size is _DRAIN_BATCH_SIZE
    (10 games), producing ~1-5 M+B flaw rows each (~50 rows max) — well within
    the memory envelope. No asyncio.gather on this session.

    Skips GameNotAnalyzed games silently (chess.com / low eval coverage).
    Per-game classify errors are Sentry-captured and the loop continues (T-108-04:
    one bad game must not abort the whole drain batch).

    D-10: reuses classify_game_flaws (the single classification kernel) and
    flaw_record_to_row (the single FlawRecord→row mapping) so the materialized
    table never drifts from the live kernel.
