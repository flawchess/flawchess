"""Shared write-path orchestration for the full-ply eval pipeline (Phase 150 R7 / WRITE-04).

Physically relocated (not re-exported) from `app/services/eval_drain.py` and
`app/routers/eval_remote.py` so both live write lanes -- the in-process
`_full_drain_tick` (eval_drain.py) and the atomic-submit worker endpoint
(`_apply_atomic_submit`, eval_remote.py) -- consume ONE shared implementation of:

    - the classify preamble (`_classify_with_overlay`, R4),
    - the flaw diff/upsert (`_classify_and_fill_oracle`, R3),
    - the Path A/B/C completion decision (`apply_completion_decision`, R1),
    - the full-ply eval write + flaw-blob assembly primitives these depend on, and
    - `apply_full_eval(...)`, the shared write_session body both lanes call.

Dependency direction (Pitfall 3, RESEARCH.md): this module is a LEAF. It must
NEVER import from `app.services.eval_drain` or `app.routers.eval_remote` --
both of those import FROM here. `eval_drain.py` re-imports a subset of the
symbols below (for its own full-lane orchestration AND to preserve backward
compatibility for existing test/script imports that reference
`app.services.eval_drain.<symbol>` -- those names are simply re-bound into
eval_drain's namespace via import, not re-defined, so external callers are
unaffected by the physical relocation).

`_build_flaw_blob_lease_positions` (the tier-4 flaw-blob-only lane) is also
relocated here even though RESEARCH.md's R7 section marks the tier-4 lane as
functionally isolated from the live-submit path (D-04 isolation boundary) --
that isolation is about NOT sharing write semantics with the live path, not
about which file the code lives in. Moving it here (rather than leaving it in
eval_drain.py) is what makes eval_remote.py's private-helper import block
disappear entirely (Task 1 acceptance criterion), without merging its logic
with apply_full_eval.

         under cap: do NOT stamp either marker. Increment full_eval_attempts so
         the game is re-picked next tick with a fresh look at the same budget.
      C. failed_ply_count > 0 AND current_attempts + 1 >= MAX_EVAL_ATTEMPTS ->

         including best_moves_completed_at IFF maia_available, and invoke the
         caller-supplied on_path_c_capacity_reached callback exactly once. This
         is the EXPECTED terminal state of the bounded-retry drain, not an error.

    maia_available (Phase 176 BACK-01/D-01, THE guardrail): whether the process-
    wide Maia session was loaded (maia_engine.is_maia_available()) at the time
    apply_full_eval built best_move_rows. best_moves_completed_at is stamped on
    Path A/C ONLY when this is True — a Maia-absent backend must NEVER stamp it,
    or the game would be permanently excluded from the tier-4b backfill lottery
    with zero best-move rows (_build_best_move_candidates returns [] for BOTH
    "Maia ran, zero candidates" and "Maia absent" — row count alone cannot
    distinguish them). The stamp is source-agnostic (fires regardless of
    is_lichess_eval_game) — the lichess exclusion lives ONLY in the tier-4b
    lottery predicate, never here, mirroring full_pv_completed_at's own
    unconditional stamping. Defaults to False so any caller that does not thread
    this through explicitly gets the SAFE behavior (never stamps).

    Path-C reporting is deliberately NOT unified: eval_drain.py's in-process tick
    uses logger.warning (FLAWCHESS-5V — an earlier per-tick Sentry call burned the
    error quota reporting this expected, non-bug outcome); eval_remote.py's atomic
    submit uses sentry_sdk.capture_message. on_path_c_capacity_reached is the
    caller-injected callback so each lane keeps its own mechanism; source is
    threaded through to the callback (e.g. for a Sentry tag) rather than used to
    branch reporting behavior here.

    eval_jobs stamp: only when stamp_complete AND job_id is not None (tier-3
    derived claims have no job row). The `WHERE status = 'leased'` guard makes a
    late/expired-lease submit (lease already re-claimed or already completed) a
    safe no-op — it can never complete an unrelated job (T-150-LEASE).

         asserts exactly one row matched and raises StaleDataError on a 0-row
         match — FLAWCHESS-8D).
      2. INSERT `desired_plies - existing_plies` (brand new flaws) via the
         unchanged flaw_record_to_row + bulk_insert_game_flaws — nothing to
         preserve for a ply that never existed before.
      3/4. UPDATE `desired_plies & existing_plies`, split by freshly_blobbed:
         freshly-blobbed rows get the full row (fresh tactic-tag columns too);

         into the blob write below rather than a separate caller-side restore —
         never a `COALESCE(EXCLUDED.col, ...)` upsert (a bound Python None
         serializes as a real json `null`, not SQL NULL, via asyncpg —
         project_asyncpg_jsonb_null_vs_sql_null — which would silently wipe
         every preserved blob on the first upsert).
    The PV-line write (allowed_pv_lines/missed_pv_lines) runs INSIDE this
    function immediately after the row partition, via _batch_update_flaw_pv_lines,
    filtered to exclude "preserve" plies (existing, not freshly blobbed) — a
    ply's blob columns are therefore never even written a D-06 `[]` sentinel in
    the first place when it should be preserved, so there is nothing to restore
    afterward. This folds what used to be the caller's separate _run_multipv2_pass
    call into the diff/upsert itself (D-03: the write is fully self-contained);
    callers no longer call _run_multipv2_pass separately (deleted, Plan 04).

    Args:
        session: Write session (same transaction as _apply_full_eval_results).
        game_id: The game being classified.
        engine_result_map: {ply -> (eval_cp, eval_mate, best_move, pv_string)} from
            the engine pass — PVs are not yet in game_positions at classify time.
        flaw_pv_blobs: Optional {flaw_ply -> (allowed_blob, missed_blob)} MultiPV-2
            blobs built in memory by _build_flaw_multipv2_blobs (Phase 142, D-02).
            MUST be passed from the call site — blobs are NOT yet in the DB when
            classify runs (Pitfall 4: classify precedes the blob write below).
            When None (old games without blobs, or nothing assembled this pass),
            the gate is skipped for all flaws and freshly_blobbed is empty (every
            existing ply's blob/tactic columns are preserved-by-omission).
        blobs_pending: Phase 147 (D-01/D-03) — forwarded unchanged to
            classify_game_flaws. Defaults to False (local drain / discovery
            behavior unchanged, D-05). The remote go-forward call site
            (_apply_submit) passes True so cp-based flaws whose continuation blob
            is deferred to the tier-4 pass are suppressed to NULL instead of
            persisted raw/ungated.

    Errors in the flaw delete/insert/update statements and the oracle-count UPDATE
    are intentionally NOT caught here — they must propagate to the caller so the
    write-session transaction is aborted and the completion markers
    (_mark_full_evals_completed / _mark_full_pv_completed) are NOT committed
    (WR-01). Only the per-flaw PV writes (both game_positions.pv below and the
    game_flaws blob write above) are individually fault-tolerant (a single bad PV
    row must not abort the whole game).

    T-108-04 still applies at the drain-tick level: _full_drain_tick wraps the entire
    write phase in its own exception boundary so one bad game never aborts the drain.

    Reconstructed from the DEEPEST non-terminal target's `board.move_stack` — a
    chess.Board snapshot carries its own full push history regardless of which
    OTHER targets happen to be present in `targets` — plus that target's own
    `move_san` (the move about to be played FROM that position, i.e. its ply's
    own contribution to the prefix). Every target in a single game's `targets`
    shares the same linear move history by construction (`_collect_full_ply_targets`
    walks the PGN exactly once), so reconstructing the prefix from the single
    deepest target is sufficient — no need to walk every target.

    Book moves are always a prefix from ply 0, and find_opening_ply_count stops at
    the first non-book move, so only this prefix matters.

    Robustness (CR-01, 174-REVIEW): the prior implementation built the prefix by
    walking `targets` ply-by-ply from 0 using each target's own `move_san` field
    (`{t.ply: t.move_san ...}`, `while ply in san_by_ply`). That walk depended on
    ply 0 being PRESENT as its own entry in `targets` — a sparse/pre-filtered
    `targets` list missing ply 0 (the historical local-drain lichess-eval shape,
    before Phase 174-06 Task 1 retired that filter) made the walk stop
    immediately, silently collapsing book depth to 0 and misclassifying a
    genuinely in-book ply as out-of-book. This implementation never depends on
    ply 0 being present in `targets` — only on the deepest target's own board
    carrying real history, true for every real call site (both `_full_drain_tick`
    and `_apply_atomic_submit` build boards via one continuous PGN/game walk).
    After Task 1 both production lanes pass full/contiguous ply-0-anchored
    targets anyway, so this is defense-in-depth for a sparse/future caller, not
    load-bearing for either lane today (174-REVIEW CR-01 reframed).

    the played move with backend Maia-3 at the mover's pinned+clamped ELO (GEMS-05)
    and emit a candidate row (raw continuous storage — the Gem/Great tier is decided
    at query time, GEMS-01/07).

    Session discipline (CLAUDE.md hard rule, mirrors _build_flaw_multipv2_blobs):
      - candidate identification is pure in-memory (targets + engine_result_map),
      - the Pitfall-1 targeted evaluate_nodes_multipv2 fallback runs in ONE
        asyncio.gather with NO session open,
      - the game's rating metadata is read in a short session that is CLOSED before
        any Maia inference,
      - the returned rows are UPSERTed later by apply_full_eval in its own late write
        session, so they land in the SAME commit as the rest of the eval (T-174-12).

    Pitfall 1: a ply missing from second_best_map (None/empty map, or a ply the map
    simply doesn't cover) gets a bounded, backend-owned evaluate_nodes_multipv2(board)
    fallback — NOT a worker-protocol change (the extra Stockfish `go` runs on the
    backend's own SCHED_IDLE pool). Phase 177 PROTO-03 made this the RARE case for
    the remote-worker lane (v2 workers submit their own second-best data via
    `second_best`, threaded through by the caller); it stays the COMMON case for a
    tier-4b/local-drain caller that hasn't computed second-best itself.

    source (Phase 177 D-06/OBS-01): a caller-supplied label (e.g. "drain-local",
    "worker-submit-fallback") tagged on the Sentry event emitted when the fallback
    branch fires, so a worker-submit-path fallback (the S-04 regression signal,
    expected ~zero post-shift) is queryable independent of the expected drain-local
    fallback noise. Defaults to "drain-local" for the existing local-drain/tier-4b
    call sites, which do not (yet) pass this explicitly.

    Returns [] (no rows, no crash) when Maia is disabled (score_move returns None
    because onnxruntime is absent), the game is gone, or anything unexpected fails —
    a lean/misconfigured backend must never abort eval-apply over gem detection.

    never read or written here.

    Flow:

       `_build_bestmove_lease_positions` uses (D-03: lease and submit reconstruct
       from the identical source of truth, so they structurally agree).
    3. Tamper guard (T-177-05): a submitted ply outside `[0, game_length)` is
       422'd before any write. An in-range ply that is NOT a real candidate is

       mirroring the established second_best guard precedent (177-01-SUMMARY.md).
    4. Delegates to `_build_best_move_candidates` (reused verbatim — the margin
       gate + pinned-ELO Maia scoring are NOT re-derived here) with the worker's
       submitted evals as `second_best_map`.

    completion markers, inside the CALLER's write_session (T-117-11 — one commit).

    This is the post-R1/R3/R4 `_apply_atomic_submit` write-session body, generalized
    so BOTH `_full_drain_tick` (eval_drain.py) and the router's `_apply_atomic_submit`
    (eval_remote.py) call this ONE function for the shared write phase, instead of each
    inlining its own copy of "evals -> classify -> oracle -> completion -> heartbeat".

    Does NOT open or commit the session — the caller owns session lifecycle (mirrors
    apply_completion_decision's existing convention) so per-module test monkeypatches
    of `async_session_maker` continue to route to the correct session exactly as
    before the move (eval_drain.py's own async_session_maker for the drain tick,
    eval_remote.py's own async_session_maker for the router).

    Sequencing (unchanged from the pre-move _apply_atomic_submit / _full_drain_tick
    write phases): _apply_full_eval_results -> _classify_and_fill_oracle -> optional
    flaws_written count -> optional opening-cache upsert -> apply_completion_decision
    -> optional worker-heartbeat upsert. All inside the same write_session (T-117-11);
    none of these calls are wrapped in try/except here (WR-01 fail-closed contract —
    errors must propagate to abort the caller's transaction).

    update_opening_cache / upsert_opening_cache_fn (Pitfall 4): `_full_drain_tick`
    passes update_opening_cache=True with `_upsert_opening_cache` (eval_drain.py,
    NOT moved here — it stays full-lane-only) as upsert_opening_cache_fn, preserving
    its current behavior. `_apply_atomic_submit` leaves update_opening_cache=False
    (its current behavior — the opening cache is NOT populated from atomic-submit
    workers). This is a deliberate, explicit parameter (not silently unified) per
    RESEARCH.md Pitfall 4 / D-05.

    record_heartbeat / heartbeat_*: `_full_drain_tick` does not call
    upsert_worker_heartbeat today (leaves record_heartbeat=False); the router's
    atomic-submit wrapper passes record_heartbeat=True with its worker_id/last_ip/
    sf_version/worker_schema_version/n_evals (PRUNE-06 telemetry — a sibling call to
    apply_completion_decision, not folded into it).

    count_flaws_written: the atomic-submit wrapper needs flaws_written for its
    response payload (a cheap indexed COUNT); the drain tick has no such need and
    defaults this off to avoid adding an unnecessary query to its per-tick cost.
