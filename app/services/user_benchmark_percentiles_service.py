"""Per-user pooled percentile compute service.

Phase 94.4 Plan 05b — cohort-keyed percentile cutover
-----------------------------------------------------

Rewrite of the post-94.3 service to consume the new cohort CDF artifact
(``COHORT_PERCENTILE_CDF`` via ``interpolate_cohort_percentile``) and the
per-(user, TC) median rating anchor (``user_rating_anchors``). The old
flat 12-name TC-suffixed Stage B metric tuple retires; Stage B now iterates
``STAGE_B_METRIC_FAMILIES`` (7-tuple) × the user's above-floor TCs and
the legacy 2-arg ``interpolate_percentile`` helper is no longer called.

Stage A (eval-independent — wired into import completion per D-03):

  1. Compute and UPSERT per-(user, TC) median rating anchors via the
     ``compute_anchors_for_user`` helper. Anchors come FIRST (RESEARCH
     Pitfall 9 backfill ordering) so the per-TC ``score_gap`` percentile
     lookup downstream can read the anchor's ``anchor_rating`` to key
     into ``COHORT_PERCENTILE_CDF[(anchor, tc)]``.
  2. For each TC where an anchor exists, run
     ``per_user_cte_score_gap_tc(tc, source='single_user', ...)`` to read
     the user's per-TC ``score_gap``, then interpolate against the
     cohort CDF at ``(metric='score_gap', anchor=<lichess-equivalent>,
     tc=<bucket>)`` and UPSERT one
     ``user_benchmark_percentiles(user_id, metric, time_control_bucket)``
     row.

Stage B (eval-dependent — wired into eval drain per D-01): for each
metric family in ``STAGE_B_METRIC_FAMILIES`` × each TC with an above-floor
anchor, dispatch to the matching per-TC builder, interpolate against the
cohort CDF, and UPSERT one row per (family, tc).

Game-weighted blended anchor (D-12 Reversal Amendment, 2026-05-27):

  ``compute_anchors_for_user`` implements the blended anchor per the
  D-12 Reversal Amendment. Per-game conversion is done SQL-side via the
  ``chesscom_conversion_lookup`` VALUES CTE in
  ``per_user_cte_median_anchor(blend=True)``:

  - chess.com (non-Daily) games: converted per-game to lichess-equivalent
    via the nearest anchor in ``CHESSCOM_BLITZ_TO_LICHESS``.
  - Lichess games: pass through native rating unchanged.
  - The per-user median of the combined pool is the blended anchor.
  - Per-platform game counts and native medians are persisted alongside
    the blended anchor for tooltip disclosure (D-07 bullet 4, amended).
  - Suppression rule: skip TC if pooled count < MEDIAN_ANCHOR_MIN_GAMES.

  The original Lichess-precedence rule (D-12 original) and the
  ``_compute_median_anchor_for_platform`` / ``_user_has_lichess_games_in_tc``
  helpers are retired. Design-decision record:
  ``.planning/notes/percentile-anchor-d12-reversal.md``.

Both stages remain non-blocking — exceptions are captured to Sentry and
swallowed (D-04); neither propagates back to the import worker or drain
coroutine.

Sentry pattern (CLAUDE.md Backend Rules):
  Variables flow into ``sentry_sdk.set_context("percentile_compute",
  {...})`` (user_id, stage, metric, tc) BEFORE
  ``sentry_sdk.capture_exception(exc)``. No variables in error messages —
  preserves Sentry issue grouping per CLAUDE.md.

Security (V5 — T-94.2-03-01 / preserved):
  ``user_id`` flows through every CTE via the SQLAlchemy named bindparam
  ``:user_id`` on static SQL templates (no f-stringed user input).

Session discipline (CLAUDE.md hard rule):
  Each ``compute_stage_*`` opens its own session via the resolved
  ``session_maker`` factory. The session is never shared with the trigger
  site (D-04).

``session_maker`` keyword parameter (enables Plan 06 backfill):
  Both entry points accept an optional ``session_maker`` kwarg. When
  None, they fall back to ``app.core.database.async_session_maker``.
  When provided, they use the injected factory — this lets the backfill
  script target a different DB URL without mutating module-level state.

Stage A / Stage B race-condition non-issue (RESEARCH Pitfall 2):
  Stage A owns ``(score_gap, *)`` percentile rows + ALL anchor rows.
  Stage B owns the other 7 metric families × {bullet, blitz, rapid,
  classical}. The PK is now ``(user_id, metric, time_control_bucket)``
  so disjoint writes never collide.
