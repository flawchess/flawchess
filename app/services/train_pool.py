"""Pool-entry SQL assembly for Train (Phase 189).

POOL-01: a user's own qualifying blunder becomes a `drill_items` candidate
when (a) the mover is the user (ply-parity via `player_only_gate` —
`app/repositories/query_utils.py` documents a prior off-by-one bug in this
exact area; NEVER hand-roll `ply % 2`), (b) it is a blunder
(`game_flaws.severity == 2`), (c) an answer key exists — a NON-EMPTY
`game_flaws.missed_pv_lines` array (see `answer_key_present`; a non-NULL but
EMPTY `[]` array is the eval pipeline's D-06 "un-fillable" sentinel and is
excluded exactly like true SQL NULL, 189-06 gap closure), and (d) the
PRE-flaw-move position clears the winnability floor.

Winnability floor eval source (Pitfall 2, LOAD-BEARING): `game_positions.eval_cp`
is post-move shifted — the eval AT row `ply` describes the position AFTER
move `ply`. The floor must read the PRIOR row's eval (`ply - 1`, the position
BEFORE the flaw move, which is what the drill puzzle actually presents), via
an aliased self-join (`PriorPosition`) — never the flaw ply's own row. Do NOT
reuse `library_repository.is_decided_lost`/`decided_lost_sql`: that predicate
is a stricter, differently-purposed "already decisively lost" cutoff for tag
suppression on the Flaws tab, not this feature's softer ~20-25% expected-score
floor (Pitfall 6).

    stored `game_positions.best_move` for the flaw's own ply (decision-keyed:
    row `ply`'s OWN best move for the pre-move position). No blob/worker-
    pipeline change (D-04 stays intact). A SHARP puzzle falls out EMPTY
    through this same predicate with no `puzzle_type` branch anywhere:
    `classify_puzzle_type`'s sharp gate (`>= SHARP_GAP_ES`, which aliases
    `MISTAKE_DROP`) is strictly outside the good band, so a sharp node's `su`
    can never clear `_vetted_move` — and the lone-best fallback (WR-01, see
    the fix-site comment below) re-applies that exact same sharp gate, so a
    sharp node never serves a lone best entry either.

    Returns `[]` — never raises — for every degenerate shape: a non-dict
    node, `su` absent or the empty-string sentinel (no legal second move),
    or either expected score resolving to None (missing cp/mate on either
    side).

    Args:
        node: `missed_pv_lines[0]` (a `PvNode`-shaped dict), or anything —
            degenerate shapes yield `[]`.

            `mover_color_for_ply(ply)` for an SR blob, NEVER a stored color
            column (see `pool_entry_stmt`'s parity rationale).
        best_uci: The deep best move's UCI (`game_positions.best_move` at the
            flaw ply), or None when unavailable (not yet backfilled, orphaned
            game link) — the list then degrades to today's su-only shape.

    Returns:
        Zero, one or two `VettedMove`s in the server's best-first order (a
        DOCUMENTED CONTRACT of the vetted list — callers must not re-sort):
        `[best, su]` when both are available, `[su]` when the best UCI is
        unknown, `[best]` when the `su` fails the good band but the node is
        still soft-shaped (gap `< SHARP_GAP_ES`) and the best UCI is known
        (WR-01 — a "soft" puzzle must never advertise "several fine moves"
        with zero servable alternatives), `[]` otherwise (sharp node, or an
        uncertified `su` with no known best UCI).

    (`app/services/eval_apply.py`'s `_assemble_one_line_blob` /
    `_batch_update_flaw_pv_lines`) stores a non-NULL, EMPTY `[]` JSONB array
    for an answer-key line it could not fill (NULL prior-ply PV, or a PV walk
    shorter than 2 nodes). A bare `col.isnot(None)` test therefore admits a
    flaw with no usable answer key — directly contradicting POOL-01 and
    ROADMAP Success Criterion 1, both of which require a NON-EMPTY
    `missed_pv_lines` blob. This predicate closes that gap by requiring the
    value to be a JSON array AND not the empty-array literal.

    The `jsonb_typeof(col) == "array"` clause does double duty: it rejects
    the empty-array sentinel's siblings (a `null::jsonb` scalar, which can
    land in this column instead of true SQL NULL via the documented asyncpg
    None-binding gotcha — `project_asyncpg_jsonb_null_vs_sql_null`) as well
    as any other non-array JSONB shape.

    Every clause here is a TOTAL operator (`IS NOT NULL`, `jsonb_typeof`,
    `<>`) — deliberately NOT an array-element-count check gated by a
    preceding `jsonb_typeof` test. Verified directly against the dev DB:
    Postgres does not guarantee AND-clause evaluation order, so pairing
    `jsonb_typeof(...) = 'array'` with an array-count guard can still raise
    `cannot get array length of a scalar` when the planner evaluates the
    count function before the type guard (see 189-06-PLAN.md's
    `<gap_reference>` Fact 2 for the exact reproduction). Do NOT "simplify"
    this back to a count-based form — it is a live crash, not a style

    gap clears Proposal A's dead band (D-05/D-11, SEED-137, Phase 205).

    The band is `[INACCURACY_DROP, BLUNDER_DROP)` — CLOSED at the lower edge,
    OPEN at the upper edge: a gap of exactly `INACCURACY_DROP` is EXCLUDED, a
    gap of exactly `BLUNDER_DROP` is KEPT and stays sharp. The 0.05 buffer
    (rather than the measured `ES_STABILITY_TOLERANCE` of 0.025) stands on
    SEED-130's rationale: the browser's Stockfish never clears its
    transposition table, so evaluator 2's reading of a position depends on
    what that Worker slot searched before.

    BOTH of D-03's degenerate node-0 shapes are excluded HERE, at the
    selection predicate, rather than in `classify_puzzle_type` — that
    function keeps its current return contract (it is a classifier, never an
    entry gate, P-04): the no-legal-second-move sentinel (`su == ""`) and an
    unreadable blob (a non-object node 0, or either expected score
    resolving to NULL).

    non-empty JSON array (mirroring how `answer_key_pending`'s docstring
    cross-references its own sibling below).

    Mover color is derived from ply parity (`mover_color_expr`), never
    `Game.user_color` — every candidate row this predicate is ever applied to
    is already the user's OWN ply by construction (the player-only gate at
    pool entry), so ply parity and `Game.user_color` always agree for these
    rows. This is what lets the SAME predicate serve
    `get_waiting_puzzle_count`'s due-count statement, which deliberately
    drops the `Game` join.

    The total-operator hazard `answer_key_present`'s docstring documents was
    checked and does not apply here: this predicate pairs a JSONB type test
    with plain index/field extraction, never with an array function, and
    every operator here returns NULL rather than raising on wrong-shaped
    input (verified against the dev DB during research).

    `b`/`s` are cast to a float type, not an integer type: the boundary tests
    construct `b` via the exact sigmoid inverse, which is a non-integer, and
    an integer cast of a non-integer text value raises in Postgres — exactly
    the crash `answer_key_present`'s total-operator discipline forbids.

    the mover still clearly winning (SEED-141).

    Investigation findings (derived from the code, not assumed — see the
    plan's `<investigation>` block):

    1. SIGN / COLOR. `s`/`sm` are WHITE-perspective (confirmed via
       `app/models/game_flaw.py`'s D-05 blob-shape comment: "s — second_cp
       (int | null): second-best-move eval in centipawns, WHITE-perspective"
       and `app/services/forcing_line_gate.py`'s `PvNode` TypedDict restating
       the same convention). Mover POV is derived from ply parity via
       `mover_color_expr(ply_col)`, exactly as `dead_band_admissible` does it
       — never `Game.user_color` — so this predicate can serve the
       Game-join-free `get_waiting_puzzle_count` COUNT statement too.
    2. PLY OFFSET. `app/services/eval_apply.py`'s `_build_line_blobs` sets
       `node0_ply = flaw_ply` for the "missed" line (`node0_ply = flaw_ply if
       line == "missed" else flaw_ply + 1`) and reads `pos_eval[node0_ply]` /
       `second_best_map[node0_ply]` directly — `pos_eval` is a
       POSITION-keyed map (the eval OF that ply's position). `_post_move_eval`
       (the SINGLE site of the eval-pipeline's +1 post-move storage shift,
       per its own docstring) is used only when writing `game_positions`
       rows, never when assembling `missed_pv_lines`/`allowed_pv_lines`
       blobs. So node 0 of `missed_pv_lines` is decision-ply-keyed: `b`/`s`
       are the MultiPV-1/MultiPV-2 scores AT the flaw's own decision
       position — exactly "if the mover plays the runner-up instead of the
       best move" — and NO offset correction is needed here.
    3. MATE. `sm` is white-perspective mate distance (positive = white is
       mating), matching `bm`'s convention. Mover-POV mate is the
       ply-parity-sign-flipped value, computed the same way `expected_score_sql`
       flips cp. A mate FOR the mover (mover-POV mate > 0) is the degenerate
       "still winning" case this predicate exists to catch and is EXCLUDED;
       a mate AGAINST the mover (mover-POV mate < 0) is KEPT. Mate takes
       priority over cp — checked as an independent OR branch, matching
       `expected_score_sql`'s branch order, so a node carrying both `sm` and
       `s` (mate takes priority even when `s` also happens to be populated)
       resolves on the mate branch regardless of `s`'s value.
    4. NULL. See the predicate contract below.

    Predicate contract — written in POSITIVE (admissible) form with explicit
    `IS NULL` guards, never a bare `NOT` over a NULL-yielding comparison (the
    seed's warning: a bare `s_mover_cp >= threshold` under a `NOT` yields NULL
    for the sentinel/unreadable rows and silently drops every one of them).
    Admissible is TRUE when:
    - `su` is the empty-string sentinel (no legal second move -> nothing can
      "still be winning" -> unconditionally admissible), OR
    - mover-POV mate is present AND is a mate AGAINST the mover, OR
    - mover-POV mate is absent AND (mover-POV `s` is NULL, i.e. unreadable
      and therefore unprovable, OR mover-POV `s` is strictly below
      `SECOND_BEST_WINNING_FLOOR_CP`).

    An unreadable node-0 (`s`/`sm` both NULL) is KEPT here, not dropped: this
    predicate is an EXCLUSION rule and cannot prove "still winning" from a
    NULL. Unreadable node-0 blobs are already excluded by
    `dead_band_admissible` running in the same WHERE (it requires
    `best_es.isnot(None)`/`second_es.isnot(None)`), so nothing leaks through
    this predicate alone — do not tighten this into a NULL-drops form.

    Callers MUST also apply `answer_key_present(missed_pv_lines_col)` (and,
    in practice, `dead_band_admissible`) in the same WHERE — this predicate
    assumes an already-validated non-NULL, non-empty JSON array, mirroring
    `dead_band_admissible`'s own cross-reference to `answer_key_present`.

    `s` is cast to Float, not Integer — same reasoning as
    `dead_band_admissible`'s `b`/`s` cast: an integer cast of a non-integer
    text value raises in Postgres. `sm` stays Integer-cast (a whole number,

    user's entire index range on every outer row — 108M rows filtered,
    ~21-27s wall time. The identical predicates as a `LATERAL` subquery

    Phase 192 replaces the structurally-broken pre-Phase-192 `GameBestMove`
    source with `herring_pool` — a global, phase-balanced pool of positions
    confirmed by a real MultiPV-5 Stockfish search
    (`scripts/gen_red_herring_pool.py`). A
    red herring is "several genuinely fine moves for whoever is to move",
    drawn across ALL signed-up users' games, not "one of the user's own
    several-fine-moves plies". Winnability (`WINNABILITY_FLOOR_ES`) is
    enforced once at generation time against the generator's own MultiPV[0]
    on its own searched board — never re-checked here, and never derived
    from a correlated `game_positions` read (SEED-120 Pitfall 1's
    `ply`/`ply - 1` ambiguity does not apply: the generator's board is
    authoritative by construction). There is no SR bookkeeping in this
    function at all (no `drill_items`, no `GameFlaw` join) — the pool is
    entirely separate material from a user's own blunders.

    D-15 loose-generation / tight-query split, both constants named: the
    generator applies a deliberately LOOSE gate at write time
    (`HERRING_LOOSE_BAND_ES`, `HERRING_MIN_QUALIFYING_MOVES`) so a stored row
    is a superset of what could ever qualify at serve time. THIS function
    applies the real, tight, retunable-with-zero-re-analysis gate over the
    raw stored `ladder`:

    - **Qualifying count** (D-15): at least `HERRING_MIN_QUALIFYING_MOVES` of
      the 5 ladder entries must be within `INACCURACY_DROP` expected-score
      points of PV[0] (the best move). PV[0] always satisfies its own
      predicate (gap 0.0 to itself), so a count of 2 means "the best plus one
      genuinely fine alternative" — not "two alternatives besides the best".
      The comparison is STRICT (`<`, not `<=`), and that direction is
      load-bearing: `flaws_service.classify_severity` classifies a drop as
      an inaccuracy at `drop >= INACCURACY_DROP`, so a move exactly
      `INACCURACY_DROP` below the best is already an inaccuracy and must not
      count as one of the "several fine moves" this gate exists to certify.
    - **Degenerate exclusion** (D-17): PV[4]'s (the worst-of-five's) expected
      score must be at least `HERRING_DEGENERATE_MIN_GAP_ES` below PV[0]'s,
      INCLUSIVE at the bound (`>=`) — a dead-drawn or totally-winning
      position where even the fifth-best move is fine is not a judgment
      test, and MultiPV-5 exists precisely to catch it. Kept at QUERY time
      rather than baked into generation: retunable without re-analysis, and
      later auditable for over-aggressiveness, because the raw 5-move ladder
      always survives on the row (D-16 forbids a pre-converted
      expected-score/gap column, so the stored `game_positions.eval_cp` can
      never leak back in as an authoritative value here).

    Both thresholds are computed from the raw stored ladder through
    `_ladder_element_es` (a thin wrapper over `expected_score_sql`, the
    single shared sigmoid) — mate is mapped via `MATE_CP_EQUIVALENT` before
    the sigmoid (Option-B), matching every other mover-POV conversion in this
    module. No second sigmoid is declared and no rounding/truncation step is
    introduced anywhere in this gate.

    No `jsonb_typeof` shape guard is added anywhere here, deliberately:
    `ck_herring_pool_ladder_shape` (a write-time CHECK on `herring_pool`)
    makes "a complete 5-element JSON array" a structural invariant of every
    stored row, so `jsonb_array_elements(HerringPool.ladder)` and indexed
    access (`HerringPool.ladder[_PV_BEST_INDEX]`,
    `HerringPool.ladder[_PV_WORST_INDEX]`) are TOTAL on this column. Pairing
    a type guard with an array function in the same WHERE clause is a
    documented live crash in this codebase — Postgres does not guarantee
    AND-clause evaluation order (see `answer_key_present`'s docstring).
    Enforce shape at write time, never re-check it at read time.

    `.options(undefer(HerringPool.ladder))` is mandatory: `ladder` is
    `deferred=True` by design (structural leak guard, mirroring
    `GameFlaw.missed_pv_lines`) and would otherwise raise `MissingGreenlet`
    on first implicit async access outside this query's session context.

    Ordering is a TOTAL order, stable across repeated executions of the same
    statement — which is what makes "no repeats until the pool is exhausted"
    observable:
    `(qualifying_count >= HERRING_PREFERRED_QUALIFYING_MOVES) DESC` (D-15's
    "preferring 3+" — a PREFERENCE, not a filter; rows with exactly
    `HERRING_MIN_QUALIFYING_MOVES` must still be reachable), then
    `HerringPool.source_played_at DESC NULLS LAST`, then `HerringPool.id
    ASC` (the deterministic tiebreak for rows equal on both prior keys).
    Recency reads off the pool row's own denormalized `source_played_at`
    rather than a `games` join: SEED-120 carries the recency ordering
    forward, but a global pool cannot join `games` for it without
    reintroducing exactly the link D-01 lets null out. Copying `played_at`
    onto the row at generation time preserves the recency contract and
    survives source-game deletion — the same reasoning D-03 already applies
    to the FEN and arriving move. This is a deliberate resolution, not a
    dropped requirement.

    D-10: this function NEVER filters on `HerringPool.user_id` — a user may
    legitimately be served a herring drawn from their own game (own-game
    herrings are permitted; composition drops one only when it collides with
    an SR pick in the same session, `app/repositories/train_repository.py`'s
    `_ReconstructedPuzzle` assembly).

    Exhaustion contract (unchanged): when a caller's `exclude_served=True`
    query returns no rows, it re-runs with `exclude_served=False` to allow
    repeats — that fallback lives with this query's contract, not duplicated
    at call sites.

    Args:
        user_id: Authenticated user's internal PK (V4: never client-supplied
            — callers must source this from `current_active_user.id`). Used
            ONLY to scope the `exclude_served` no-repeat exclusion below —
            never as a `HerringPool` row filter (D-10).
        exclude_served: When True (default), exclude any `HerringPool.id`
            already served to this user as a red herring
            (`drill_solves.herring_pool_id`, D-04 — NOT `(game_id, ply)`,
            which can no longer serve as a stable identity once the source
            game link is nullable). Set False to allow repeats once the
            source is exhausted.

    doubling the opening share and cutting the endgame share to a third — so
    a uniform pick is what actually reproduces the user's natural blunder
    distribution across a game's candidate plies.

    two independently-seeded RNG streams, deliberately kept apart.
    `game_id` is baked INTO the seed (not just `user_id`/`session_date`), so

    `PYTHONHASHSEED`-randomized `hash()`) — the same property the existing
    D-09 shuffle already relies on. This is intentionally NOT pushed into
    SQL: `pool_rows` is already materialized in Python by the time a caller
    has a `candidates` sequence to pass here.

    Groups by `game_id` in FIRST-APPEARANCE order (a plain `dict` preserves
    insertion order), so the caller's own across-games ordering (e.g.
    `Game.played_at DESC`) survives unchanged in the concatenated output —

    """Reconstruct the FULL FEN and the arriving move's UCI at `ply` (190-02).

    The single PGN-replay implementation shared by `full_fen_at_ply` (FEN
    only) and every Train puzzle-construction site that also needs the
    arriving move. P-03: `game_flaws.fen` is `board_fen()` (piece placement
    only — see its model docstring) and loses castling rights/en-passant,
    which a drill puzzle needs for legal-move generation. Parses `pgn` and
    replays `ply` half-moves. Wrapped in try/except per the project's
    PGN-parsing constraint (per-game try/except, handle malformed input
    gracefully) — an unparseable PGN or a ply past the game's end is an
    EXPECTED case for old/malformed imports, not a bug, so it is not
    `sentry_sdk.capture_exception`'d.

    The returned move describes HOW the position was reached — the
    half-move immediately before `ply` (the opponent's or the user's own
    prior move) — and is deliberately NOT answer-key data: it never reveals
    what to play next, only what was just played (T-190-05).

    Args:
        pgn: The game's full PGN text.
        ply: The half-move index to reconstruct the position at (0 = the
            starting position).

    Returns:
        `(fen, last_move_uci)`, where `last_move_uci` is None at ply 0 (no
        prior move exists), or None if the PGN could not be parsed or `ply`
        is past the end of the game. Callers (composition) must drop a
        puzzle whose FEN cannot be reconstructed rather than serving a
        broken board.
