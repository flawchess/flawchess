"""Flaw-detection + classification service for Phase 105 (SEED-036).

Derives per-ply flaw severity and attribution tags from stored Stockfish evals.
No I/O, no DB — the module is a pure Python transform over already-loaded ORM objects.
See tests/services/test_flaws_service.py for unit tests.

Two output types:
  list[FlawRecord]   analyzed game — one entry per user mistake or blunder
  GameNotAnalyzed    chess.com / unanalyzed lichess game (< 90% eval coverage)

Note: inaccuracies are detected internally (for counts and the oracle test) but are
NOT emitted as FlawRecord items. Only mistakes and blunders appear in the returned
list. An inaccuracy-only analyzed game returns an empty list — distinct from
GameNotAnalyzed. See the 2026-06-05 amendment in 105-01-PLAN.md.

        positions: All GamePosition rows for this game, ordered by ply ASC.
            Load via flaws_repository.fetch_game_positions_ordered.
        pv_by_ply: optional {ply -> pv_string} override for tactic detection
            (260618-aiq). The in-process eval drain passes freshly-computed PVs
            here because they are not yet written to game_positions at classify
            time; without it the live drain would tag every flaw NULL. The
            backfill path omits it and reads PVs from positions[n+1].pv.
        flaw_pv_blobs: optional {flaw_ply -> (allowed_blob, missed_blob)} mapping
            of MultiPV-2 PvNode blobs built in memory by the eval drain (Phase 142).
            When provided, _build_flaw_record routes tactic classification through
            _classify_tactic_gated which applies the forcing-line gate (D-02, SC4).
            None (default) preserves the pre-Phase-143 gate-free behavior.
        blobs_pending: Phase 147 (D-01/D-03) — independent signal, defaulting to
            False and NEVER derived from flaw_pv_blobs, meaning the continuation
            blob for every flaw in this game is deferred to a later tier-4 pass
            (the remote go-forward submit path). When True, cp-based flaws that
            cannot yet be gate-checked (no blob, pre_flaw_eval_cp not None) are
            suppressed to NULL instead of persisted raw/ungated; mate-adjacent and
            D-06 []-sentinel flaws are FINAL cases and keep their raw tag.

    Returns:
        list[FlawRecord] for analyzed games — one entry per user mistake or
        blunder (inaccuracies are count-only, NOT emitted). An inaccuracy-only
        analyzed game returns an empty list, distinct from GameNotAnalyzed.

        GameNotAnalyzed when eval coverage < EVAL_COVERAGE_MIN (chess.com games,
        unanalyzed lichess games). Never returns a false zero-flaw game (LIBG-02).
