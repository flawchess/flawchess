"""Cold-lane eval drain coroutine for Phase 91 / SEED-023.

This module owns the in-process background coroutine that evaluates entry plies
for games whose `evals_completed_at IS NULL`. It is the structural fix for the
OOM-kill failure mode described in SEED-022/023 — by moving Stockfish work out
of the hot import lane (which caused 20-40 s held transactions) into this
dedicated background loop with short, well-bounded transactions.

Key architectural invariant:
    asyncio.gather() over engine_service.evaluate() MUST run OUTSIDE any open
    AsyncSession scope. Per CLAUDE.md hard rule: AsyncSession is not safe for
    concurrent use from multiple coroutines, and holding a session open during
    multi-position fan-out is the structural OOM driver.

Session discipline per tick:
    1. _pick_pending_game_ids: short read tx, then CLOSE.
    2. _load_pgns_for_games: short read tx, then CLOSE.
    3. asyncio.gather (no session open).
    4. Write session: open LATE, UPDATEs + commit, CLOSE.

Phase 91 / SEED-023 locks:
    D-09: engine (None, None) marks game complete — no permanent retry loop.
    D-11: LIFO id-DESC pick, batch size 10.
    D-12: no per-user fairness at current scale.
    D-13: idle sleep 5s when queue empty.

Quick 260521-d6o follow-up:
    Target collection is single-walk per game — one chess.pgn.read_game + one
    mainline traversal yields board snapshots at every target ply, instead of
    one parse-and-walk per target ply. Public wrappers
    (_collect_midgame_eval_targets, _collect_endgame_span_eval_targets) keep
    their original signatures for the hot-lane Stage 5c covered-game gate in
    import_service.py:_collect_covered_game_ids.

    via the WHERE guard below). pv alone self-heals: SEED-076 follow-up — a pre-existing
    cache row written before the pv column existed (or whose engine pass raced without a
    pv) stays pv-less forever without this backfill, which permanently blocks the
    atomic-submit path from carrying a walkable PV for any flaw that lands on that
    position. DO UPDATE SET pv = EXCLUDED.pv only fires when the existing row's pv IS
    NULL AND the new value is non-NULL, so it never clobbers a real cached pv and never
    touches eval_cp/eval_mate/best_move on conflict.

    Insert volume is self-limiting: as the cache fills, fewer misses reach here each tick.

    The INSERT is inside the existing Step-4 write transaction. If it fails the whole txn
    rolls back and the game is re-picked next tick — acceptable, as the eval writes have
    not committed either. No outer try/except is added (we do not swallow cache errors).

    Uses CAST() instead of :: cast syntax for asyncpg compatibility (same reason as
    _batch_update_eval_rows).

    The lichess path pre-classifies flaws from stored %evals up front (_flaw_engine_plies)
    and exempts {flaw_ply, flaw_ply + 1} from dedup so they always get a real engine pass
    (PV + best_move). Fresh engine games can't do that — they have no evals until AFTER
    the gather — so an opening-region flaw ply whose full_hash matched a dedup donor gets
    an eval-only transplant with NO pv. The flaw is registered but un-taggable (no
    refutation line for the SEED-039 motif classifier), and the better-alternative PV at
    flaw_ply is lost too.

    Fix: once the gather is done we DO know every ply's eval (engine_result_map for
    engine plies, dedup_map for transplanted ones). Reconstruct the post-move evals
    in-memory, classify, and return the dedup-transplanted {flaw_ply, flaw_ply + 1}
    targets that still lack a pv. The caller runs a tiny second engine gather on these
    boards and merges the results back into engine_result_map before the write session,
    so classify + the PV write pick the pv up exactly as for any engine-evaluated ply.

    """Re-arm already-stamped engine games that still carry non-terminal holes (SEED-045).

    Before Phase 119, the drain stamped full_evals_completed_at unconditionally (D-116-07),
    so games with transient mid-game engine holes were permanently marked "fully analyzed"
    with gaps. This sweep finds those games and clears their completion markers so the
    bounded-retry drain re-picks them with a fresh MAX_EVAL_ATTEMPTS budget.

    A "hole" is a non-terminal, non-game-ending-move, non-mate ply:
        eval_cp IS NULL AND eval_mate IS NULL AND ply < MAX(ply) - 1 for that game.
    The MAX(ply) exclusion skips the terminal game-over ply (which has no DB row of its
    own in most games but may appear as the last row in some PGNs). The additional
    `- 1` (SEED-049) further excludes the game-ending move ply (ply = max_ply - 1):
    under post-move storage, that row stores the eval of the game-over terminal
    position, which is legitimately unevaluable (no legal moves; the engine skips it in
    _collect_full_ply_targets). Resignation/timeout endings whose last move has a real
    eval are unaffected — their last move is not NULL. Only the genuinely unevaluable
    terminal-move NULLs (checkmate, stalemate, insufficient material) are excluded.
    The 2 genuine mid-game holes observed in prod are at ply < max_ply - 1, so this
    exclusion is precise and safe.

    Scope: engine games only (lichess_evals_at IS NULL). Lichess %eval games are already
    excluded from the full-drain and need no re-arming.

    Args:
        limit: cap the candidate scan at this many games (None = all).
        dry_run: count candidates without performing the UPDATE. Useful for prod inspection
            before running for real.
        session_maker: optional sessionmaker override (e.g. a prod-tunnel-bound maker from
            scripts/resweep_holed_games.py --db prod). Defaults to the app's
            async_session_maker (bound to DATABASE_URL — the dev DB locally).

    Returns:
        Count of games swept (cleared) or that would be swept (dry_run=True).

        uv run python scripts/resweep_holed_games.py --db prod --dry-run   # count only
