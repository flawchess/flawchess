"""Guest cleanup service: purge game data for guests inactive >= 30 days (SEED-116).

Implements the already-advertised but never-built 30-day-inactivity guest
cleanup (Phase 187). Eligible guests (``is_guest=true``, ``last_activity``
older than ``_GUEST_INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD``) have their games and all
cascading children purged and their import cursor mechanisms reset, but
their ``User`` row + auth + bookmarks + import-settings preferences survive
(D-05) so a returning guest can log back in and simply re-import.

Phase 224 (D-08): a guest's Train rows do NOT survive the purge. Once Train
opened to guests (Phase 224 D-01, reversing Phase 189 D-05's guest gate) a
guest can accumulate real ``drill_sessions``/``drill_solves``/
``train_settings`` rows, and ``/welcome`` advertises "nothing is deleted
after 30 days of inactivity" as a sign-up delta -- honest only if a purged
guest's Train state goes with their games. See ``_purge_guest`` for the two
deletes and ``tests/test_guest_cleanup_service.py::
test_purge_guest_cascades_drill_rows`` for the proof.

Plan 01 built the eligibility query, the per-guest purge, and the per-tick
orchestration loop (``cleanup_inactive_guests``). Plan 02 (this module's
``run_periodic_guest_cleanup``) wraps that orchestration in a periodic
``asyncio`` task and wires it into the FastAPI lifespan, mirroring
``run_periodic_reaper`` (``app/services/import_service.py``).
