"""chess.com API client.

Fetches game archives for a user and yields normalized game dicts.
Rate limits are respected by sleeping 150ms between archive fetches,
with a 60-second backoff on 429 responses.

When chess.com's /games/archives index endpoint 404s for a real user (ambiguous
body, player endpoint returns 200), the client falls back to enumerating monthly
archive URLs from the player's joined date to the current month. Individual
monthly archives that 404 are skipped; transient 5xx/429 errors are retried by
the existing per-archive loop.
