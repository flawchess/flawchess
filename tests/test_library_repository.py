"""Integration tests for app.repositories.library_repository (Phase 106-01).

Uses a real PostgreSQL database via the db_session fixture (rolled-back per test).
Covers the Wave-0 seam guards from 106-VALIDATION.md:

- `-k exists_filter` — the user-color-scoped EXISTS severity filter selects games
  with >=1 USER ply of the requested severity, excludes clean games, and EXCLUDES
  a game where only the OPPONENT blundered (B1 guard).
- `-k analyzed_denominator` — placeholder, implemented in 106-03.

Note: The SQL<->kernel cross-check (B2, `TestCrossCheck`) was retired in Phase 108
Plan 03 (D-02 migration). The `game_flaws` table IS the materialized kernel output,
so there is no longer a separate SQL path that could drift from the kernel. The new
invariant is tested in `tests/test_flaw_predicate.py`.

Reuses _seed_game / _seed_position helpers patterned on tests/test_flaws_repository.py.
