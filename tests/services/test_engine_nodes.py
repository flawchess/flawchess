        Why it holds (python-chess 1.11.2 source):
          - `Protocol.analyse` (L1127-1132) awaits the result inside `with analysis:`.

            `UciAnalysisCommand.start` (L1712) -> `.cancel()` (L1766) sends `stop`.
          - Stockfish answers `stop` with `bestmove`, which reaches
            `UciAnalysisCommand._bestmove` (L1758-1763) -> `set_finished()`
            (L1268) -> resolves the command's `finished` future.
          - `Protocol.communicate` (L986-1021) queues the NEXT command as
            `next_command` and only `_start()`s it from
            `previous_command_finished` (L1001-1012), i.e. AFTER that `finished`
            future resolves. The next `analyse()` is therefore serialized behind
