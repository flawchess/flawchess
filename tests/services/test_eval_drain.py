"""Cold-drain architectural invariant tests for Phase 91.

Tests cover:
- gather-outside-session structural invariant (AST scan + static check)
- LIFO pick order (id DESC, batch=10)
- Idempotency: crash before commit leaves rows pending, re-picked next tick
- Engine (None, None) marks game completed — no permanent retry (D-09 / R-02)
- Partial index used for the LIFO pick query (ix_games_evals_pending EXPLAIN check)
- Cancellation propagates without retry (lifespan shutdown contract)

Integration tests that need to test code which opens its own sessions (like
run_eval_drain's helper functions) must commit data to the test DB and clean
up explicitly. We use the test_session_maker (backed by test_engine) directly
for test data inserts that need to be visible across sessions, and monkeypatch
app.services.eval_drain.async_session_maker to route drain sessions to the
test DB (same pattern as test_import_service.py).

Phase 91 / SEED-023 locked decisions exercised here:
    D-09: engine (None, None) → game still marked evals_completed_at = NOW()
    D-11: LIFO id-DESC, batch size = _DRAIN_BATCH_SIZE
    D-13: idle sleep = _DRAIN_IDLE_SLEEP_SECONDS (not tested for duration)
    T-91-06: stuck game at LIFO head gets marked done via D-09 guard
    T-91-08: gather-outside-session enforced by static AST test (CI regression)
    T-91-09: idempotency on crash verified by test_idempotent_on_simulated_crash
