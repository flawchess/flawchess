"""Tests for app.services.guest_cleanup_service (Phase 187, SEED-116).

Covers:
- TestPurgeGuestEndToEnd: _purge_guest deletes games + 5 cascading children +
  import_jobs + the 2 derived-stats tables, resets both backfill-cursor
  mechanisms, and leaves the guest User row + bookmarks + user_import_settings
  row (and its tc_*/game_cap preferences) untouched (D-03/D-04/D-05/D-06,
  Pitfall 1/Pitfall 2, 187-RESEARCH.md).
- TestEligibilityQuery: get_eligible_guest_ids selects only guests inactive
  >= 30 days, excluding recent guests, NULL-last_activity guests, and
  registered (non-guest) users.
- TestTransactionPerGuest: a failure purging one guest does not roll back or
  block another guest's already-committed purge (D-06 isolation).
- TestCleanupSummaryLog: cleanup_inactive_guests emits one summary log line
  carrying scanned/purged/games_deleted counts (D-07).

Uses the real per-run test DB via a genuine (non-savepoint) session bound to
test_engine -- see the module-scoped fixtures below for why the usual
rollback-scoped `db_session` fixture cannot be used for tests that exercise
_purge_guest/cleanup_inactive_guests: those open their OWN
async_session_maker() session (D-06: one transaction per guest) on a
SEPARATE physical connection, and Postgres MVCC means that connection can
never see another connection's uncommitted work. TestEligibilityQuery calls
get_eligible_guest_ids directly with an explicit session (no separate
connection involved), so it uses the ordinary rollback-scoped db_session
fixture.

Note: tests using real_session_maker commit for real (no rollback), so
residual guest rows can persist in the per-run test DB across tests in the
same session. Assertions below are written to tolerate that (membership
checks / >= bounds on aggregate counts) rather than asserting exact global
row counts.

    """A genuine (non-savepoint) sessionmaker bound to the per-run test DB.

    The usual `db_session` fixture binds an AsyncSession directly to an
    ALREADY-begun Connection (`conn.begin()` then `AsyncSession(bind=conn)`),
    which puts SQLAlchemy's session into `join_transaction_mode=
    "conditional_savepoint"` -- since the connection already has an open
    transaction, the session's own `commit()` only releases a SAVEPOINT; the
    real outer transaction stays open until the fixture's teardown
    `conn.rollback()`. That is invisible to any OTHER connection (standard
    Postgres MVCC) -- confirmed via a scratch repro where a game committed
    through `db_session` read back as 0 rows from a second connection.

    _purge_guest opens its own D-06 per-guest session on a genuinely separate
    connection, so test data it must see has to be committed for real. This
    fixture (mirroring conftest.py's own `fresh_test_user` pattern) provides
    a sessionmaker whose sessions own their transaction outright, so
    `.commit()` is a real, cross-connection-visible COMMIT.

        """The 30-day guest purge deletes the guest's Train rows with the
        games (Phase 224 D-08, GUESTACT-10, ROADMAP SC 8).

        `_purge_guest` deletes the guest's `drill_sessions` row, which
        cascades every `drill_solves` row through `session_id` (`ON DELETE
        CASCADE`), and the guest's `train_settings` row, in the same
        transaction as the existing games cascade that removes `drill_items`.

        This supersedes the Phase 189 D-04 "preserved by design" reading FOR
        GUESTS ONLY: Phase 224 opened Train to guests (reversing Phase 189
        D-05's guest gate), so a guest now accumulates real Train state, and
        `/welcome` advertises "nothing is deleted after 30 days of
        inactivity" as a sign-up delta -- honest only if a purged guest's
        Train state goes with their games. Registered users' D-04
        preservation is untouched (see class docstring above).

        The seed includes a second `drill_solves` row with `game_id=None`
        (a sharp-filler solve, `source=SHARP_FILLER`) on the SAME session as
        the game-derived solve -- this is the row the games cascade
        provably CANNOT reach (it has no `game_id` to cascade through), so
        its deletion is the entire proof that the explicit
        `delete(DrillSession)` statement, not the games cascade, is what
        removes it.

        Guest-owned rows are cleaned up by the module's autouse
        `_cleanup_leaked_guest_rows` fixture (deletes the guest User row,
        cascading every FK'd child) -- no separate finally block is needed
        since this test creates no non-guest rows.
