"""Smoke tests for the FastAPI lifespan in app/main.py.

Phase 91 Plan 05: verifies that both background tasks (reaper + eval drain)
are spawned at startup and cancelled cleanly at shutdown, and that a
drain-side exception during shutdown is logged rather than propagated.

No real DB or engine connections are made — all startup hooks and background
tasks are replaced with in-process stubs via monkeypatch.
