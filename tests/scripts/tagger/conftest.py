"""Shared fixtures for the tagger validation harness.

This harness is entirely offline: it reads the committed fixture CSVs
(fixtures/tagger/detector_fixture_train.csv and detector_fixture_test.csv) and
runs the detector against them. No database connection, no asyncio, no network.

Train/test split (anti-overfitting): the self-improvement loop and the CI floor
gate optimize/measure against the TRAIN set; the TEST set is held out for honest
validation (scored but never used to tune detectors or set floors). Both files are
produced by scripts/select_tagger_fixtures.py with a deterministic PuzzleId-hash
split, so a puzzle never leaks across the two sets.

CC0/AGPL boundary (SC#4, D-11): the puzzle data is CC0 / Public Domain
(database.lichess.org). The puzzle labels were produced by
lichess-puzzler/tagger/cook.py (AGPL-3.0). We use only the published CC0
dataset; cook.py is neither vendored nor ported here.
