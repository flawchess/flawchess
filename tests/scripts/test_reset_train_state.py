"""Tests for scripts/reset_train_state.py's settings branch.

The drill_items/drill_sessions/drill_solves deletes are plain single-table
statements; the branch that actually makes a choice is what happens to
`train_settings`. The default path must clear ONLY the per-day tick snapshot
(streak_count/shield_level/streak_settled_through/pool_eligible_since) and
keep the schedule (timezone / weekday_mask / puzzles_per_session) the user
picked — re-selecting a schedule after every reset would defeat the purpose of
the tool — while `--reset-settings` drops the row so first-touch defaults come
back.

Fixture order matters: `fresh_test_user` MUST come before `db_session` in
every signature. Teardown runs in reverse of setup, and `fresh_test_user`'s
teardown DELETEs the user row — which blocks indefinitely on the FK reference
held by `db_session`'s still-open transaction if that session is torn down
second. Listed in this order, `db_session` rolls back (releasing the lock)
before the delete runs.
