"""Phase 70 repository SQL contract tests — INSIGHT-CORE-02, INSIGHT-CORE-03, INSIGHT-CORE-04.

Precondition: The composite primary key on game_positions (user_id, game_id, ply)
must exist in the test database before test_partial_index_predicate_alignment runs.
SEED-035 replaced the former surrogate-id PK + the separate partial ix_gp_user_game_ply
index with this natural composite PK (migration f4d88c3659c6); the PK now provides the
same (user_id, game_id, ply) ordered access path the opening-insights window function
relies on. Ensure `uv run alembic upgrade head` has been applied. The test will FAIL
(not skip) if the PK is absent.

All tests use a real PostgreSQL database via the db_session fixture (rolled-back
transaction per test). The db_session fixture is provided by tests/conftest.py.
