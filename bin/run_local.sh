# This used to be `fuser -k 8000/tcp`. macOS ships BSD fuser, which has no
# `-k` and no `<port>/tcp` syntax, so on a Mac the command only ever printed
# its usage text and freed nothing — leaving uvicorn to die with
# "[Errno 48] Address already in use" a hundred lines further down the log.
# lsof behaves the same on macOS and Linux, so the backstop now works on both.
#
# `-sTCP:LISTEN` is not optional: a bare `lsof -ti tcp:5173` also matches
# ESTABLISHED client sockets, which means the browser tab connected to the
# dev server shows up as a "port holder" and would get killed.
#
# A listener that is not ours is reported and fatal, never killed. Port 8000
# is a popular default and another project's server is not this script's to
# terminate; failing fast here beats the old silent-then-confusing failure.
# Ownership is decided by the absolute repo path appearing in the command
# line, which covers both `<repo>/.venv/bin/python <repo>/.venv/bin/uvicorn`
# and `node <repo>/frontend/node_modules/.bin/vite --host`.
