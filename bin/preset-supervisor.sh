# Self-healing supervisor for a Phase-180 bot-curves preset (light or deep).
#
# WHY: both blend>0 presets crashed after ~5.5-6h with an onnxruntime-web wasm
# "memory access out of bounds" in Maia policy inference (nodePolicy ->
# InferenceSession.run, calibration-providers.mjs:125). The wasm linear heap
# faults on long-lived runs; a fresh process clears it. The harness ledger is
# append-mode resumable (calibration-harness.mjs:1578/1594), so a resume
# re-reads every logged game and continues, losing at most the one in-flight
# game per crash. This supervisor relaunches --resume on any crash until the
# harness writes its final -cells.tsv (clean completion). nohup => survives a
# session end.
#
# FAST-CRASH GUARD: if the harness dies < MIN_HEALTHY_SECS after launch
# FAST_FAIL_LIMIT times in a row, this is a real bug (not the slow wasm leak),
# so the supervisor exits loudly instead of hot-looping. A healthy run (>=
# MIN_HEALTHY_SECS) resets the counter.
#
# Usage: preset-supervisor.sh <name> <blend> <elo-csv> [adopt-pid]
#
# Env overrides (all optional, defaults preserve the original Phase-180 behavior):
#   PRESET_SUPERVISOR_DIR    out-dir for this run (default reports/data/sweep-<name>)
#   PRESET_SUPERVISOR_GAMES  --games-per-cell for the harness (default 24)

# Overridable so a caller that owns its own out-dir layout (e.g. the Phase-184
# persona sweep, which needs one dir per PersonaId) does not have to match this

# created `persona-sweep-<id>/` while this script wrote to `sweep-<id>/`, so
# every log/nohup redirect below failed, the harness never launched, and the
# fast-crash guard aborted after three 0-second "runs".
