# Chess Data Stories — Rules

Rules for the public data-story site (`stories/`, deployed to https://stories.flawchess.com/ by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`). See `stories/README.md` for deployment/DNS details.

The blog is named **Chess Data Stories** (not "FlawChess Data Stories"): use that name in page `<title>`s, the header label, and bylines.

## Workflow (no GSD)

Data-story work is exempt from GSD phase planning: no roadmap phase, no PLAN.md, no executor agents. Work directly on a long-lived `study/<slug>` branch (e.g. `study/game-review-study`) covering the whole study — EDA notebook, generation scripts, report, and story — and squash-merge it to `main` when the story ships. Seeds under `.planning/seeds/` may still track story ideas and findings; they just don't spawn phases.

## Analysis rules (every study, from the first EDA query on)

- **Always apply the equal-footing filter**: only score games where the two players are within 100 rating points (`abs(white_rating - black_rating) <= 100`, the canonical `EQUAL_FOOTING_FILTER` in `scripts/benchmarks/sql.py`). The 2400 bucket faces systematically weaker opponents (thin pool at the top), which biases every per-bucket outcome; the filter removes that. Sequence features (streaks, sessions, breaks, rematches) may be computed over the full game history, but the games whose *outcome* enters a statistic must pass the filter, and calibration/expected-score tables must be fitted on filtered games only.

## Structure

- One directory per story: `stories/<slug>/index.html` (kebab-case slug = URL). Self-contained pages: inline CSS/JS, vanilla SVG charts, no CDNs or JS libraries. The only allowed external resources are Google Fonts (Fredoka, for the brand label) and the Umami analytics tag (below).
- **Co-locate the technical report**: the report a story summarizes lives next to it as `stories/<slug>/<slug>-report.md` (short name, e.g. `two-pawns-up-report-latest.md`), not under `reports/`. The story footer links to it via its GitHub blob URL.
- Add a card for every new story to `stories/index.html`, including its publication date.
- **Generation scripts do NOT live here.** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` uploads `stories/` verbatim, so anything in a story directory is served publicly — a `.py` file next to `index.html` ends up at `https://stories.flawchess.com/<slug>/<file>.py`. Scripts that produce a report belong in `scripts/<study>/` (underscored slug: `scripts/two_pawns_up/`), which is also where their root-venv dependencies (`app/`, SQLAlchemy) actually resolve. The report `.md` still co-locates with the story; only the code moves. See `analysis/README.md`, "Where a study's pieces live", for the three-directory split.

## SEO & sharing (required for every story)

- **Head tags**: unique `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">`, the favicon pair (`<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="32x32">` + `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="128x128" href="/logo.png">` — root-absolute paths; `stories/favicon.ico` must exist or search engines show a generic globe icon), full Open Graph set (`og:type=article`, `og:site_name`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image` + width/height, `article:published_time`, `article:author`) and Twitter Card (`summary_large_image`), plus a JSON-LD `Article` block (`isPartOf` the Chess Data Stories `Blog`, author Adrian Imfeld, publisher FlawChess). Copy the block from `two-pawns-up/index.html`.
- **Social card**: a 1200×630 `social-card.png` in the story directory, referenced with an **absolute** `https://stories.flawchess.com/...` URL (scrapers don't resolve relative og:image paths). Render it from a brand-styled HTML card via headless Chrome (`google-chrome --headless=new --window-size=1200,630 --screenshot=...`); show the story headline and its hero stat(s).
- **Sitemap**: add the story URL to `stories/sitemap.xml` (and bump the landing page's `lastmod`). Update the landing page's JSON-LD `blogPost` list too.
- **Landmarks**: page content lives in `<main class="wrap">`.

## Analytics (required on every page)

Every page under `stories/` carries the Umami tag in `<head>`, right after the Google Fonts link:

```html
<!-- Umami analytics (self-hosted, privacy-friendly, no cookies) -->
<script defer src="https://analytics.flawchess.com/script.js" data-website-id="62d4b783-3457-45f2-8098-f3f1e14a8fa4" data-domains="stories.flawchess.com"></script>
```

- The stories site is its own Umami website (ID above), **separate from the flawchess.com app site** — story traffic is mostly cold inbound from search and social, and mixing it into the app's numbers muddies both funnels. Never reuse the app's `data-website-id` (`0ca19960-…`, in `frontend/index.html`).
- **`data-domains` is required**: the tracker sends nothing unless `location.hostname` matches, which keeps local previews out of production stats. The flip side is that a wrong or missing value fails *silently* — the page looks fine and no events arrive.
- This is a deliberate exception to the "self-contained, no CDNs" rule. It stays safe for local preview because the tag is `defer`red and failure-tolerant: if `analytics.flawchess.com` is unreachable the page renders normally, with one failed request in the console.
- **Verifying the tag**: Umami's bot filter silently drops events from a `HeadlessChrome` user agent, so a headless check looks broken when it isn't. Pass `--user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 … Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"` to record a real pageview. To confirm the tag works *without* writing a row into production stats, load with the default headless UA and check the net log for a `POST` to `analytics.flawchess.com/api/send` — the request proves the `data-domains` check passed, and the server drops the event as a bot.

### Outbound link tracking (required)

Umami does **not** track outbound clicks automatically (that's Plausible). Every link leaving the stories site needs an explicit `data-umami-event` attribute, otherwise the click is invisible:

```html
<a href="https://flawchess.com" data-umami-event="outbound-flawchess-cta">Analyze your own games free at flawchess.com &rarr;</a>
```

- **Tag every external `<a>`**: the header brand link, the footer CTA, report/GitHub links, author links, and any site named in the story body. Internal links between stories need nothing — they already produce a pageview.
- **Naming**: `outbound-<destination>`, kebab-case (`outbound-github`, `outbound-linkedin`, `outbound-next-level-chess`). When the same destination appears more than once on a page, suffix the placement so the two are distinguishable in the dashboard (`outbound-flawchess-header` vs `outbound-flawchess-cta`). Reuse the exact same event name across stories for the same link, so totals aggregate.
- **Citations share one event.** Links to sources cited in the story body (other people's analyses, papers, blog posts) all use `data-umami-event="outbound-citation"` with the destination as event data, `data-umami-event-url="<host>"`, so the dashboard keeps one event row and the per-source breakdown lives under that event's properties. Per-destination names are for links with a role of their own (brand, CTA, report, author).
- No `target="_blank"` is needed: for a same-tab link the tracker intercepts the click, sends the event, then navigates.
- Clicks land in the stories Umami site under **Events**, not under pageviews, and are subject to the same `data-domains` gate — local preview clicks are never recorded.

## Header (must match the flawchess.com homepage)

- Logo + "FlawChess" label, with the tagline ("Engines are flawless, humans play FlawChess.") right-aligned.
- The label uses the homepage brand font: **Fredoka, weight 600**, `letter-spacing:-.02em` (load via Google Fonts).
- Logo and label are wrapped in a single `<a href="https://flawchess.com">`.
- After the brand link, a "Chess Data Stories" blog-title label (`.sect`: same Fredoka style, brand brown, thin left border) linking to the stories index (`./` from the landing page, `../` from a story page). Below 560px, `.name` and `.sect` shrink to 19px and the tagline hides.
- Full-width fine grey bottom border: `border-bottom:1px solid var(--line)` on the header, with the flex content in an inner `.wrap` (header sits outside the page's `.wrap` so the line spans the viewport).

## Content & copy

- **Publication date is mandatory**: show it in the hero kicker as `<time datetime="YYYY-MM-DD">Month D, YYYY</time>`, and repeat it on the landing-page card.
- Plain-language copy for a non-technical audience ("two pawns up", not "200 cp").
- **Terminology must match the underlying technical report.** Don't invent story-side synonyms for defined terms (e.g. the report's "sustained lead" stays "sustained lead", not "wire-to-wire").
- **Em-dashes very sparingly** — at most one per page section; prefer commas, parentheses, colons, or semicolons.
- Every chart gets a `<details>` "View the data" table; all numbers live inline in the page (no fetches).
- **Story footer, in order** (copy the markup from `two-pawns-up/index.html`): the "About this analysis" box (methodology, report link, data fineprint), then the **FlawChess card** (`.promo`: logo + Fredoka brand name + tagline, a short pitch **tailored to the story's topic** (2–3 sentences naming the features that answer the question the story just raised; NO feature-bullet grid — a full feature list reads as an ad and undermines the story's credibility), the flawchess.com CTA button, "All features free · no signup required · open source"), then the **author card** (`.author`: circular photo `stories/author.jpg` (shared asset, CSS `border-radius:50%`), name "Adrian Imfeld", short bio, LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimfeld/) + GitHub (https://github.com/aimfeld) links). The CTA button lives in the FlawChess card only, not in the About box. The landing page keeps only the one-line footer byline, not the full cards.

## Visual style

- FlawChess branding: brand brown `#8B5E3C`, cream background `#FAF7F0`, warm ink/line palette (see existing stories' `:root` tokens).
- **WDL colors**: win = green, loss = red, **draw = grey** (`#8A7F71`, the `--ink-3` warm grey). Never violet/purple for draws.
- **Chart anatomy, top to bottom: title → legend/controls → plot.** The title is an HTML element above the chart (`.ctitle`, ~18px bold ink-2, clearly bigger than 14px `.axis` labels), never drawn inside the SVG (HTML wraps natively on narrow screens). The legend (or toggle buttons acting as one) sits between the title and the `<figure>`, so readers get the color key before the marks. Captions/source notes go below the chart.
- Prefer direct labeling over a legend where it fits (e.g. end-of-line series labels on wide screens); order legend items to match the visual order of the series.
- Colorblind-safe series palettes.
- **Charts must be mobile friendly with no horizontal scrolling**: re-render each SVG at the container width on resize (viewBox width = container width so font sizes stay true), and drop end-of-line series labels in favor of a legend below ~700px. Only the "View the data" tables may scroll horizontally.
