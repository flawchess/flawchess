## Milestone: v1.1 — Opening Explorer & UI Restructuring

**Shipped:** 2026-03-20
**Phases:** 6 | **Plans:** 15

### What Was Built
- Move explorer: next-move W/D/L stats, click-to-navigate, transposition warnings, board arrows
- UI restructuring: tabbed Openings hub, dedicated Import page, shared filter sidebar
- Enhanced import: clock data, termination, time control fix, username-scoped sync
- Game cards: 3-row layout, lucide-react icons, hover/tap minimap, null-safe metadata
- Bug fixes: data isolation, Google SSO last_login, cache clearing

### What Worked
- Phase dependency chain (11→12→13→14→15→16) allowed clean incremental delivery
- Human verification phase (14-03) caught real issues: hooks ordering bug, tab naming, import page redesign
- Quick tasks (19 total) handled polish effectively without disrupting phase work
- DB wipe decision removed migration complexity entirely for v1.1

### What Was Inefficient
- Phase 15 was renumbered mid-milestone (chart consolidation replaced by enhanced import data) — caused confusion in file naming with two "15-*" directories
- GCUI requirements were left at "Planned" status in traceability table despite being complete — bookkeeping drift
- summary-extract CLI returned null for one_liner fields — summaries lacked structured frontmatter fields

### Patterns Established
- Tab content as JSX variables (defined before return, reused in multiple Tabs instances)
- QueryClient singleton pattern for cross-cutting auth/cache concerns
- Username-scoped sync boundaries for multi-username import
- Single TooltipProvider wrapping lists to avoid per-item context overhead

### Key Lessons
1. Phase renumbering creates file system confusion — prefer adding at end (Phase 16) over replacing existing phase numbers
2. Human verification phases catch real bugs that automated tests miss (hooks ordering, UX issues)
3. Quick tasks are effective for UI polish during milestone execution — keeps phase scope clean

## Cross-Milestone Trends

### Process Evolution

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Key Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| v1.0 | 10 | 36 | Established GSD workflow, phase/plan structure |
| v1.1 | 6 | 15 | Added human verification phases, heavy quick task usage |

### Top Lessons (Verified Across Milestones)

1. DB wipe for schema changes is worth it in early development — migration complexity slows iteration
2. Human verification catches integration issues that unit tests miss
