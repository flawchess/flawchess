id: SEED-116
status: ready (decision made, mechanics verified)
planted: 2026-07-23
planted_during: /gsd-explore session on 2026-07-23, triggered by a user importing ~65k games from GM Hikaru's chess.com account (~5M game_positions rows). Explored import/storage/compute resource limits; converged on guest-game retention as the proportionate lever.
trigger_when: Next maintenance/pipeline window. No external blocker — the decision is made and the mechanics exist. Prioritize if guest storage growth becomes a measured concern.
scope: small (one GSD phase: a scheduled cleanup job + activity-column verification + cursor reset). Grows slightly if last_activity turns out not to be bumped on guest browsing.
priority: medium (storage reclamation + honors already-advertised copy; no registered-user-facing behavior change)

# SEED-116: 30-day-of-inactivity guest game cleanup

## Problem this addresses

Any user (registered or guest) can enter **any** chess.com/lichess username and import its
full history — there is no ownership check and no per-user game cap (`imports.py`,
`schemas/imports.py`). A 65k-game import (GM Hikaru) writes ~5M permanent `game_positions`
rows (≈80 rows/game, three 8-byte Zobrist hashes each + partial indexes). Storage is the
only genuinely **unbounded** cost — compute is already soft-rationed by the recency-weighted
tier-3 lottery, and **guests are excluded from full analysis entirely**
(`eval_queue_service.py:55`), so a guest import costs storage only.

The welcome/import page already tells guests their games are deleted after 30 days of
inactivity. That policy was never implemented — no pruning/cleanup job exists anywhere in
the code, scripts, or scheduler.

## Decision (from the explore session)

Implement a scheduled job that, for **guest** users (`users.is_guest = true`) inactive for
≥30 days, **deletes their games (+ cascading positions/flaws/bookmarks) but KEEPS the guest
User row**. Guests can still log back in later — the session lives in browser localStorage,
not the 30-day JWT — so keeping the account lets a returning guest simply re-import.

Deliberately **not** doing (this seed): any hard import cap (game-count or date-range) for
registered users. Rationale: ownership can't be verified, compute is already rationed, and
importing a foreign archive into your *own* registered account is self-punishing (it turns
your own dashboard into that player's stats). See "Deferred lever" below.

## Three implementation gotchas

1. **"Inactivity" = `users.last_activity`.** The column exists (`user.py:27`) and is already
   the eval lottery's recency signal, so it's maintained — BUT verify it's actually bumped
   on guest *browsing/activity*, not only on import. If it's only touched on import, a guest
   who keeps using the app without re-importing would be wrongly reaped. Confirm the update
   site covers general guest requests before trusting it as the inactivity clock.
2. **Reset the import cursor on cleanup.** Import is incremental off `last_synced_at`
   (`import_service.py:459`). If games are deleted but the `import_jobs` cursor is left in
   place, a returning guest's re-import syncs from that cursor and pulls almost nothing.
   Cleanup must clear/reset the cursor (delete the `import_jobs` row or null `last_synced_at`)
   so a full re-import is possible.
3. **Cascade scope.** Deleting a guest's games must cascade `game_positions` (existing
   composite FK, `game_position.py:127`) plus every other user/game-scoped child
   (`game_flaws`, bookmarks, eval_jobs, etc.). Confirm each child cascades or is handled so
   no orphan rows remain. Keep the User row and its auth intact.

Also: verify the exact advertised wording ("30 days of inactivity" vs "since creation") so
the job matches what users are promised.

## Deferred lever (do NOT build now — reserve)

Content-based import cap (game-count or date-range) for the one case the guest prune does
NOT catch: a **registered** user importing a huge **foreign** archive into their permanent
account. Trigger to revisit: guest prune shipped **and** registered oversized-import abuse
actually shows up in storage or pipeline metrics. Until then it's self-limiting and not
worth the UX cost of a cap.

## Why this is a seed, not a phase

Per project rule (no unplanned phases without explicit consent), captured as a seed. The
decision is locked and the mechanics are verified, so a future phase can start at planning.
