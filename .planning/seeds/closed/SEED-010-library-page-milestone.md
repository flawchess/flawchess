# SEED-010: Review — eval-driven mistake archive + per-mistake analysis  [CLOSED — SPLIT]

> **CLOSED 2026-06-04 — split into two seeds.** This seed carried both the whole-game analysis page and the spaced-repetition trainer. They are now separate:
> - **[SEED-036](SEED-036-library-page-milestone.md) — Library** — eval-driven mistake archive + per-mistake analysis (page name reverted Review → **Library**). This is the canonical successor for everything below except the trainer.
> - **[SEED-037](../SEED-037-train-spaced-repetition-blunder-drills.md) — Train** — spaced-repetition blunder drills; owns the `/train-sketch` prototype.
>
> Live tracking docs that referenced "SEED-010 Library" now point at SEED-036. The content below is preserved verbatim for provenance only — do not plan from it; use SEED-036 / SEED-037.

> **Filename is legacy** (`...-library-page-milestone.md`). The page was previously named "Library"; that name is dropped. See "Naming" below. The file keeps its name to avoid breaking references — the `id` (SEED-010) is the stable handle.

> **2026-06-03 rework.** This seed was substantially reshaped. The original v1 centered on a **material-delta filter** as the headline new game-level filter, with tactical/eval filters explicitly deferred behind eval coverage. That framing is **obsolete**: FlawChess now stores per-ply Stockfish evals for analyzed Lichess games, so eval-driven **mistake/blunder filters** are feasible today and become the headline. The material-delta filter is **dropped** (it was a pre-eval proxy). A **spaced-repetition blunder-training** feature surfaced during the rework and is captured as the *next* milestone (see Deferred extensions), with this milestone's data layer kept training-aware. Sections below reflect the reworked scope; the original decision log is preserved at the bottom for provenance.

## Why This Matters

FlawChess slices data by **position** (Openings) and by **type** (Endgames). There is no surface that operates on **whole games**, and nothing surfaces a player's **mistakes** — where in a game they went wrong, how often, of what severity. Users have to click out to lichess to find and step through a blunder.

We now have the data to close this: `game_positions.eval_cp` / `eval_mate` are stored **per-ply for every analyzed Lichess game** (parsed from the `%eval` annotations Lichess returns with `evals=true`). From that we can derive, server-side, exactly which plies were inaccuracies / mistakes / blunders, aggregate them across a filtered set of games, and deep-link each one to a board.

The Review page introduces:

1. A **mistake-type filter dimension** over the game archive ("show my bullet games from the last 90 days that contain a blunder"), derived on-the-fly from stored per-ply evals.
2. A **mistake-stats panel** above the filtered list: how often each mistake type occurs across the selection, normalized so it's comparable, with a trend over time.
3. A **per-game / per-mistake viewer** (board, stepper, move list, eval bar/timeline) that jumps straight to a mistake ply and can show the better move via an **on-demand server-side best-move endpoint**.

This is also the data foundation for the **blunder-training** milestone that follows (see Deferred extensions): the same mistake-detection layer feeds the spaced-repetition trainer.

## When to Surface

- User invokes `/gsd-new-milestone` and signals readiness to start the Review milestone.
- Do NOT surface mid-milestone. This is a large milestone (new page, new derived-filter, new stats endpoint, new viewer, new best-move endpoint).

## Page structure — DECIDED (S1 + Overview folded into Review)

**Decision (user, 2026-06-03):** S1 — two new top-level pages, **Review** and **Train**, and the existing thin **Overview** page is folded into Review as a subtab. Final top-level nav: `Import · Openings · Endgames · Review · Train · (Admin)`. Net change is one new top-level entry (Train); Overview demotes to a subtab, so nav crowding is contained.

- **Review** — whole-game / cross-game analysis hub. Subtabs (reuse the existing Radix URL-routed tab pattern — `<Tabs variant="brand">`, `navigate('/review/<tab>')`, deep-linkable — from Openings/Endgames):
  - **Overview** — the existing `/overview` page (`frontend/src/pages/GlobalStats.tsx`: per-platform/TC ELO timelines, WDL by TC and color) **moved in** as the default Review subtab. All-games-scoped and thin, so it's the natural top of the funnel. Migrate `/overview` → `/review` (default tab) or `/review/overview`; keep a redirect from `/overview`.
  - **Games** — filterable archive + mistake-type filters + mistake-stats panel.
  - **Analysis** — full-width board, entered from a game card or a specific mistake. (The original seed's worry that "Analysis" overpromises engine analysis is moot — it genuinely does engine analysis now: eval bar + on-demand best move.)
  - Funnel: **Overview (all games) → Games (filtered subset + mistakes) → Analysis (one game/mistake).**
- **Train** — spaced-repetition blunder drills. NEXT milestone, name TBD (see Deferred extensions).

Notes:
- **Time Management** is NOT a top-level page — it lives in the Endgames Stats tab (+ homepage blurb). Unaffected by this restructure.
- Working name **"Review"** for the parent is not hard-locked, but the structure is. Alternatives weighed and rejected: "Mistakes" (too narrow for Overview + plain archive), "Games" (collides with the Games subtab inside Openings/Endgames), "Archive" (undersells analysis).
- Open detail for discuss-phase: is Review (landing on Overview) the post-import app landing? Probably yes — confirm.

## v1 Scope (eval-driven, Lichess-analyzed games only)

### Coverage reality — read this first

Every mistake filter and mistake stat is a **subset** of the user's library:
- **chess.com**: no per-move eval from their API (only game-level accuracy). Excluded from mistake features in v1.
- **lichess, unanalyzed**: per-ply `eval_cp` is NULL. Excluded.
- **lichess, analyzed**: full per-ply eval present. **This is the only in-scope set for mistake features.**

Consequences the planner MUST handle:
- The Games subtab needs a clear, first-class **"this game has no engine analysis"** state — never imply a clean game when we simply lack evals.
- The mistake-stats panel must be explicit about the denominator (computed over analyzed games only, N shown).
- **Measure real coverage on prod before planning** (fraction of Lichess games with full per-ply eval; fraction of all games). This number decides whether v1 feels rich or sparse and whether chess.com coverage-expansion (Deferred) needs to be pulled forward. See Q-COV below.

### Games subtab — filterable archive

Reuses every existing game filter via `app/repositories/query_utils.py::apply_game_filters()` (time control, platform, rated, opponent type, recency, color). Adds the new mistake-type filter.

Each row is a **game card** showing existing summary fields plus:
- Mistake badges (e.g. counts of inaccuracy / mistake / blunder for the user in that game).
- Existing out-link to lichess.
- "Analyze" link → Analysis subtab with the game loaded, ideally landing on the first mistake.

**List defaults:** date played descending; pagination matching the existing Openings → Games subtab pattern; no user-controllable sort in v1.

### New filter: Mistake type (derived, not precomputed-column)

Filter the archive to games containing at least one mistake of a selected severity, derived **on-the-fly from stored per-ply `eval_cp` / `eval_mate`**. No new import, no new column at the `games` level (mirrors the original seed's "filter on-the-fly" decision; benchmark before adding any index — an index on `game_positions(game_id, ply)` already exists / may suffice; confirm).

**The eval→expected-score mapping is ALREADY SOLVED — do not rebuild it.** `app/services/eval_utils.py::eval_cp_to_expected_score(eval_cp, user_color)` / `eval_mate_to_expected_score(...)` implement the Lichess sigmoid (`LICHESS_K = 0.00368208`), return [0,1] user-POV, and are already reused across endgame stats. Mistake severity is a **drop in this expected score between consecutive plies** for the side to move. There is no per-ply win%-drop derivation today (only span-level gaps in `endgame_service.py`); that LAG-over-plies derivation is the new work.

**What still needs RESEARCH (Q-CLASS), do not hard-code in this seed:** the *classification layer* on top of the (solved) expected-score drop —
- The **thresholds** that bucket an expected-score drop into inaccuracy / mistake / blunder (Lichess's own cutoffs are a reference, but confirm; expected-score drops behave better than raw cp in already-decided positions, which is exactly why we use the sigmoid).
- Distinguish **two kinds of error** (user request):
  - **Player mistakes** — the user's own move dropped their win%.
  - **Opponent misses ("missed punishment")** — the opponent's move *handed* the user a swing, and the user's *reply* failed to capitalize (didn't play a clearly-best converting move). This is a distinct, valuable signal and a harder definition.
- The filter UI should let the user pick severity (inaccuracy / mistake / blunder) and likely the kind (my-mistakes vs missed-punishment), pending the research outcome.

### Detection + best-move architecture

- **Detection**: pure derivation over existing `eval_cp` per ply. Server-side query/service, no engine at detection time. Lives near `query_utils.py` / a new mistakes service.
- **Best move on demand**: a **single-position server endpoint** (e.g. `POST /api/analysis/best-move` taking a FEN, returning best move + eval, maybe top-N PV). One position is fast on the existing Stockfish `EnginePool`. Used by the Analysis subtab's "show the better move" and reused later by training.
  - **This reintroduces server-side Stockfish — but bounded.** It is single-position, user-initiated, and categorically different from the full-game-at-import server-side SF that is **permanently off the table** (OOM history, CLAUDE.md 2026-03-22 / FLAWCHESS-3Q). The endpoint MUST be rate-limited / queued (and concurrency-capped against the existing pool) so it cannot regress into the same OOM failure mode. The planner should treat this as a threat-modeled surface.

### Mistake-stats panel (Games subtab)

Above the games list, over the filtered (analyzed-only) set:
- Counts and **rates per mistake type**, normalized (per game and/or per 100 moves) so selections of different sizes are comparable.
- **Trend over time** (mistake rate by month / recency window), the headline insight — "am I blundering less than I used to?"
- Analyzed-game count N, shown explicitly as the denominator.
- Keep WDL bar if cheap, but the mistake metrics are now the centerpiece (the original seed's "WDL-bar-only, no conversion%" stance is superseded).

### Analysis subtab — per-mistake viewer

Full page width. Hosts:
- Chessboard with click/keyboard navigation through plies. Read-only stepping; the **best-move endpoint** supplies "what was better here" on demand (this is the one place a user-driven engine call happens in v1).
- **Move list (SAN)** — numbered, current ply highlighted, click-to-jump. Primary navigation alongside arrow keys.
- **Mistake markers** on the move list / timeline; "jump to next mistake" affordance. Landing on a mistake is the primary entry from a game card.
- Player names + colors, per-ply clocks, **material-balance timeline** (from `material_imbalance`, always available), **Stockfish eval timeline + eval bar** (analyzed games only; hide cleanly otherwise).
- Phase markers (opening/middlegame/endgame) from the stored `phase` column.
- "Back to Games" preserving filter state.

### Material-delta filter — REMOVED

The original seed's headline filter (preset slider −3..+3, 4-ply sustainment, on-the-fly material-window query) is **cut**. It was a proxy for "failed conversion / successful recovery" built before per-ply evals existed; eval-driven mistake filters and the existing Endgame conversion/recovery stats cover the intent better. `material_imbalance` is still used for the material timeline in the viewer, just not as a filter.

### Mobile

Drawer pattern from Openings on the Games subtab. Analysis subtab stacks indicators below the board (planner confirms in UI design). Standard tab control for subtab switching.

## Open questions for milestone discuss-phase

- **Q-CLASS (research): mistake classification thresholds + kinds.** The eval→expected-score mapping is solved (`eval_utils.py`); research is only (a) the expected-score-drop thresholds for inaccuracy/mistake/blunder, and (b) the "opponent miss / missed punishment" definition. Do this BEFORE specifying the filter UI. This is the biggest unknown.
- **Q-COV (research/measurement): eval coverage.** What fraction of Lichess games (and of all games) have full per-ply eval on prod today? Drives how rich v1 feels and whether chess.com coverage-expansion is near-term.
- **Q-NAME: page name.** Confirm or replace "Review".
- **G-1: URL deep-linking.** `/review/analysis/{game_id}?ply={N}` + Games-subtab filter state in query params (Openings precedent). Recommended default; confirm.
- **G-2: drill-in wiring from existing pages.** Which stat surfaces link into Review and with what preset? Pick a small concrete subset (e.g. Endgame conversion/recovery bars → archive pre-filtered to relevant losses; Insights endpoints linking to specific mistake plies) and explicitly defer the rest rather than leaving drill-in aspirational.

## Research items (before/early in the milestone)

Mistake classification is the load-bearing research. References:
- **Lichess** win-probability model + judgment thresholds (the `lila` "WinPercent" / advice logic) — the canonical eval→win%→severity mapping.
- **lichess-puzzler** (https://github.com/ornicar/lichess-puzzler) — how Lichess turns eval swings into tactical positions; relevant to both mistake detection and (later) training-puzzle selection.
- **chess_detect** (https://github.com/aslyamov/chess_detect) — eval-swing-based mistake/tactic detection reference.
- For the training milestone: **FSRS** (https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler) — the spaced-repetition scheduler to adopt.

## Deferred extensions (separate seeds / later milestones)

### Spaced-repetition blunder training (NEXT milestone)

The retention play, Aimchess-style ($7.99/mo there; we'd differentiate on price/openness). Present the user positions from their recent games where they blundered and ask them to play a better move; if they repeat the blunder or play another weak move, show the original blunder and the better move; re-present the position on a later spaced interval. Optional **red herrings** (positions with no clear single best move where they did NOT err) to avoid pattern-gaming — treat as v2 of training, not v1.

- **Name: TBD.** On-brand candidates lean into "flaws/fixing" (FlawChess — "humans play FlawChess"): e.g. *Fix / FlawFix*, or *Rematch / Comebacks* (replay your past mistake), or plain *Train / Drills / Practice* for a credible, coach-facing tool. Pick before the mockup.
- **GM-coach collaboration.** The user plans to recruit an experienced GM coach to co-design the training UX (what actually helps students). Kickoff artifact: an **iterable clickable prototype hosted at an unlinked route, `/train-sketch`** (not in any nav; the user shares the URL directly with the coach).
  - **Build it as a real but isolated React route, not a `/gsd-sketch` standalone HTML file** — deliberately diverging from gsd-sketch, because the prototype must be (a) reachable at a shareable https URL for an external person and (b) convincing, reusing the real chessboard component + Tailwind/theme. Mock/hard-coded data only; no training backend exists yet. Keep it self-contained (e.g. `frontend/src/pages/TrainSketch/`) and clearly throwaway so it deletes cleanly.
  - **Exposure note:** an unlinked route is still publicly reachable by anyone with the URL once deployed — fine for a mock (no real user data), but don't wire it to anything sensitive. The GM needs no account this way.
  - **Cost note:** each iteration rides the normal prod deploy pipeline (PR `main → production`, `bin/deploy.sh`). Acceptable for a handful of iterations; if it churns a lot, consider a separate static host instead.
  - **Blocker before building:** settle the **core training loop** first (see below) so we iterate the idea, not the sketch. Loop sketch: present position → user plays a move on the board → grade vs the single-position best-move endpoint → reveal (original blunder + better line) → schedule next rep (FSRS). Open loop questions for the coach/discuss: one attempt vs retry; hint / give-up affordance; show or hide eval; daily-queue / streak surface; red herrings (defer to training-v2).

- **Scheduler:** adopt **FSRS** rather than rolling our own SR math.
- **Move grading:** reuse the **single-position best-move endpoint** from this milestone. v1 of training can accept "did you find a clearly-better move" by comparing the user's chosen move's eval to the blunder and the best line — evaluated server-side on demand, one position at a time. No client-side Stockfish required for v1. (Client-side engine remains a later option for offline/scale.)
- **Why next, not now:** it's a second product pillar (review-scheduler state per blunder, interactive grading UI, progress surface), and bundling it balloons this milestone. Sequencing it right after keeps momentum while letting the archive/stats ship first.
- **Data-layer-awareness for THIS milestone:** because best-move is computed on-demand (not stored), there is *no* reimport risk — the trainer just calls the same endpoint over the same derived mistake plies. Keep the mistake-detection service cleanly reusable (return mistake plies with enough context — FEN, side, eval before/after — for the trainer to consume directly).

### chess.com (and unanalyzed-lichess) eval coverage expansion

chess.com has no API evals, so chess.com games are excluded from mistake features in v1. Two candidate mechanisms to expand coverage later (needs its own discuss-phase):
- **Client-side Stockfish** in the browser analyzing the user's games and **POSTing evals back** to the server for storage.
- **Selective server/external analysis** — e.g. analyze only recent games for users who actually engage with the training feature, on our box or an external service.
Both have cost/abuse/consistency trade-offs (and eval non-determinism across engines/machines — see the project's eval-nondeterminism note). Defer until the prod coverage measurement (Q-COV) shows it's needed.

### Tactical motif classification (missed forks / pins)

Classifying *which* motif a mistake involved (fork/pin/etc.) on top of the eval-swing signal. Higher noise, not needed to ship value. Eval-swing "you blundered here" is enough for v1 and for training. Revisit only with clear product demand.

## Out of Scope — permanently

- **Full-game server-side Stockfish at import time.** Will not happen (CPU/memory, OOM history). The on-demand single-position best-move endpoint is the *only* sanctioned server-side engine use, and only because it's bounded.
- **Tactical filters using only geometric pattern detection (no eval).** Too noisy.

## Phase Decomposition (rough sketch — planner refines)

Likely 4-6 phases:

1. **Mistake-detection service + classification.** Derive per-ply mistakes from stored `eval_cp` using the researched win%-drop method; expose player-mistakes and opponent-misses; tests against benchmark/dev data. (Gated on Q-CLASS research.)
2. **Mistake-type filter (backend).** Extend the game-filtering path so the archive can filter to games containing mistakes of a given severity/kind. Benchmark the query; add an index only if needed.
3. **Best-move endpoint.** Single-position `POST /api/analysis/best-move` on the existing EnginePool, rate-limited/queued/concurrency-capped, threat-modeled.
4. **Review page shell + subtabs (frontend).** New `/review` route with Overview/Games/Analysis subtabs (reuse Radix URL-routed tab pattern). **Migrate `/overview` → Review's Overview subtab** (move `GlobalStats.tsx`, add redirect). Games subtab: archive layout (existing filters + mistake-type control), game cards with mistake badges + "no analysis" state, mobile drawer.
5. **Analysis subtab — viewer.** Board + stepper + move list + mistake markers + jump-to-mistake + material/eval timeline + eval bar + "show better move" wired to the best-move endpoint.
6. **Mistake-stats panel.** Counts/rates per type, normalized, trend over time, analyzed-game denominator; wired to filter state.

(May merge 5+6 or split 4 if the layout is large.)

## Breadcrumbs

- `app/services/eval_utils.py` — `eval_cp_to_expected_score` / `eval_mate_to_expected_score` (Lichess sigmoid, `LICHESS_K`). The solved eval→expected-score mapping the mistake-severity drop is built on. Reuse, do not reinvent.
- `app/models/game_position.py` — per-ply `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` (Lichess `%eval` when analyzed), `material_imbalance` (signed, always present), `phase`, clocks, three Zobrist hashes. The data the mistake layer reads.
- `app/models/game.py` — game-level `white_acpl` / `black_acpl` and `white_blunders` etc. (imported from Lichess analysis). Cheap source for card badges / sanity-checking derived per-ply counts.
- `app/services/zobrist.py` (~lines 182–198) — where per-ply eval is extracted from the PGN at import. Confirms full-ply coverage for analyzed games.
- `app/services/normalization.py` (~lines 401–439) and `app/models/game.py` (~lines 111–120) — game-level Lichess judgment counts (`white_blunders` etc.). Useful for the card badges / sanity-checking derived counts, but per-ply judgment is NOT stored (we derive it).
- `app/repositories/query_utils.py::apply_game_filters()` — single source for game filtering; the mistake-type filter integrates here / in a sibling mistakes service.
- `app/services/lichess_client.py` (~lines 92–100) — the `evals=true` / `accuracy=true` request params.
- `app/services/eval_drain.py`, `scripts/backfill_eval.py` — server-side entry-ply eval backfill (NOT full-game). Context for why coverage is what it is; not the source for mistake detection.
- `frontend/src/components/Openings/` — board component, mobile drawer, filter sidebar, subtab control, Games-subtab pagination to reuse.
- `frontend/src/components/Endgames/` — stats-panel + WDL-bar layout reference.
- `frontend/src/hooks/useEvalCoverage.ts` — existing eval-coverage progress plumbing.

## Source / decision log

**2026-06-03 rework session (user + Claude):**
- Page renamed Library → **Review** (working name, not locked). Subtabs stay Games + Analysis.
- **Material-delta filter dropped** — pre-eval proxy, superseded by eval-driven mistake filters.
- **Mistake filters are the headline**, derived on-the-fly from stored per-ply `eval_cp`; Lichess-analyzed games only in v1.
- **Best move = on-demand single-position server endpoint**, not client-side Stockfish and not stored-at-import. Bounded server-side SF, must be rate-limited.
- **Two mistake kinds**: player's own mistakes vs opponent misses the player failed to punish — flagged for research, not yet specified.
- **Mistake classification needs research first** (win%-drop method; references: Lichess win-model, lichess-puzzler, chess_detect).
- **SR blunder-training = next milestone**, FSRS-based, reuses the best-move endpoint, no reimport risk; red herrings are training-v2.
- **chess.com eval coverage** expansion (client-side SF send-back, or selective server/external analysis for training users) deferred to its own thread.
- Server-side full-game SF at import stays permanently out of scope.

**2026-06-03 follow-up refinements (same session):**
- **Eval→expected-score is already solved** (`eval_utils.py`, Lichess sigmoid). Q-CLASS narrowed to just the classification *thresholds* (expected-score-drop cutoffs) + the "opponent miss" definition. No per-ply win%-drop derivation exists yet — that's the new work.
- **Page structure DECIDED: S1.** Two new top-level pages **Review** + **Train**; existing **Overview** folded into Review as its default subtab (Review = Overview · Games · Analysis). Final nav `Import · Openings · Endgames · Review · Train`. Time Management stays inside Endgames.
- **Training name TBD**; user will recruit a **GM coach** to co-design the training UX, kicked off with an **iterable hosted prototype at an unlinked `/train-sketch` route** (real isolated React route with mock data, reusing the real board/theme — not a gsd-sketch HTML file). Core training loop must be settled before building.

**Original 2026-05-01 explore-session decision log (SUPERSEDED where it conflicts with the rework above; kept for provenance):**
- Page name "Library" chosen over "Analysis page"; entry from both stat drill-downs and standalone search; game cards link to platform AND internal viewer.
- Tactical filters split: material-based filters ship v1, tactical (motif) filters deferred. *(Reworked: material filter cut; eval-driven mistake filters now ship v1; motif classification still deferred.)*
- Material-delta filter shape: preset slider −3..+3, fixed 4-ply sustainment, phase-anywhere, user POV. *(Reworked: removed.)*
- Stats panel: WDL bar + count only; conversion%/recovery% rejected. *(Reworked: mistake counts/rates + trend are the centerpiece; WDL kept only if cheap.)*
- Data model: filter on-the-fly from `game_positions`, no precomputed columns. *(Retained — applies to mistake derivation too.)*
- Move list (SAN) as primary viewer navigation; date-desc list default; pagination matching Openings Games subtab; no game-level bookmarks in v1. *(Retained.)*
- Deep-linking (G-1) and drill-in wiring (G-2) left for discuss-phase. *(Retained.)*
