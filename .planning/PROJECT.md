# Chessalytics

## What This Is

A multi-user chess analysis platform that lets players import their games from chess.com and lichess, then analyze win/draw/loss rates for specific board positions. It solves the problem of inconsistent opening categorization on existing platforms — instead of relying on opening names, users define positions visually and filter by actual piece placement. Includes an interactive move explorer showing next moves with W/D/L stats per position.

## Core Value

Users can determine their success rate for any opening position they specify, filtering by their own pieces only, regardless of how platforms categorize the opening.

## Requirements

- ✓ Display win/draw/loss rates for matching games — v1.0
- ✓ Display matching games as cards with metadata and platform links — v1.0
- ✓ Multi-user support with data isolation — v1.0
- ✓ Position bookmarks with auto-suggestions, mini boards, drag-reorder — v1.0
- ✓ Rating history and global stats pages — v1.0

- ✓ Enhanced game import: clock data, termination, time control fix — v1.1
- ✓ Game cards with 3-row layout, icons, hover minimap — v1.1
- ✓ PWA setup (manifest, service worker, installable, chess knight icons) — v1.2
- ✓ Dev workflow for phone testing (LAN + Cloudflare tunnel) — v1.2

### Active

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Mobile & PWA

**Goal:** Make the application work great on smartphones as an installable PWA, with mobile-optimized navigation and dev workflow for phone testing.

**Target features:**
- Responsive mobile navigation (hamburger menu)
- PWA setup (manifest, service worker, installable, caching for fast loads)
- Mobile UX polish (touch targets, spacing, component adjustments)
- Dev workflow for phone testing (ngrok or similar)

### Out of Scope

- Manual PGN file upload — API import only
- In-app game viewer — link to chess.com/lichess instead
- Human-like engine analysis — future: engine evaluation filtered by human move plausibility at target Elo (see Maia Chess approach)

## Context

- **Current state:** v1.2 in progress. Phase 17 (PWA foundation) complete. ~11,800 Python LOC, ~4,500 TypeScript LOC (excluding node_modules). 17 phases complete across 3 milestones.
- **Stack:** FastAPI + React 19/TS/Vite 5 + PostgreSQL + python-chess + TanStack Query + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Auth:** FastAPI-Users (JWT + Google SSO)
- **Core algorithm:** Zobrist hashes (white_hash, black_hash, full_hash) precomputed at import for indexed integer equality lookups
- **Known issues:** react-chessboard v5 arrow clearing workaround (clearArrowsOnPositionChange: false), BoardArrow local type definition

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Python backend (FastAPI), uv for package management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with asyncpg — must support efficient position-based queries across thousands of games
- **Deployment**: Must work locally and be deployable to a server
- **Libraries**: Use established open-source libraries (python-chess, etc.) rather than reinventing
- **HTTP client**: httpx async only — never use requests or berserk

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| FastAPI for backend | User expertise, async support, modern Python | ✓ Good |
| API-only import (no PGN upload) | Simpler v1, covers primary use case | ✓ Good |
| Interactive board over FEN input | Better UX for target users | ✓ Good |
| uv for package management | Fast, modern Python tooling | ✓ Good |
| React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 5 | react-chessboard 5.x requires React 19 | ✓ Good |
| PostgreSQL (no SQLite) | Multi-user concurrent writes, BIGINT index, asyncpg | ✓ Good |
| DB wipe for v1.1 | No migration needed — reimport after schema change | ✓ Good |
| Zobrist hash position matching | 64-bit integer equality vs FEN string comparison | ✓ Good |
| move_san ply semantics | SAN on ply N = move played FROM that position | ✓ Good |
| DISTINCT + GROUP BY for transpositions | COUNT(DISTINCT g.id) prevents double-counting | ✓ Good |
| Filter state in OpeningsPage parent | Survives tab switches without reset | ✓ Good |
| QueryClient singleton in lib/ | Shared across 401 interceptor and auth transitions | ✓ Good |
