# FlawChess

## What This Is

FlawChess — a free, open-source chess analysis platform at flawchess.com. Tagline: "Engines are flawless, humans play FlawChess." Users import their games from chess.com and lichess and analyze where they actually win and lose. Position matching uses Zobrist hashes (not opening names), so analysis stays consistent across platforms.

Five feature areas, mirrored on the homepage:

1. **Endgame Analytics** (hero) — WDL by endgame type, conversion/recovery rates when up/down material, Endgame ELO timeline per (platform, time control), and LLM-narrated personalized feedback on what the stats mean.
2. **Opening Explorer & Insights** — step through any position and see WDL per candidate move; an automatic 16-half-move scan surfaces opening strengths and weaknesses; works for the user and for scouting opponents.
3. **Time Management Stats** — average clock advantage/deficit at endgame entry, performance under matching time-pressure levels vs opponents, flag rates per time control.
4. **Opening Comparison & Tracking** — bookmark openings, compare WDL trends over time, filter by time control to see what works where.
5. **System Opening Filter** — filter by user's pieces only (e.g. London, King's Indian) so all opponent variations roll up under one system.

Mobile-first PWA, installable on iOS/Android, with drawer-based filter and bookmark sidebars.

## Core Value

Users get position-precise WDL analysis (openings + endgames + time pressure) on top of their actual chess.com and lichess games, with personalized LLM commentary on endgame performance and an auto-generated opening-strengths/weaknesses report. No per-platform fragmentation, no manual opening tagging.

- ✓ Admin user impersonation — superuser can impersonate any user via new /admin page, single auth_backend + ClaimAwareJWTStrategy, impersonation pill in header, last_login/last_activity frozen — v1.10 Phase 62
- ✓ LLM-backed Endgame Insights endpoint — `POST /api/insights/endgame` returns a structured `EndgameInsightsReport` (overview + up to 4 Section insights) via pydantic-ai Agent, cached on findings_hash, rate-limited 3 misses/hr, soft-fails to last cached report — v1.11 Phase 65
- ✓ Deterministic findings pipeline — `compute_findings` over `/api/endgames/overview` produces `SubsectionFinding` per subsection × window (`all_time`, `last_3mo`) with zone/trend/sample-quality annotations and three cross-section flags — v1.11 Phase 63
- ✓ Shared zone registry (`endgame_zones.py`) — single source of truth for thresholds; Python→TypeScript codegen with CI drift guard — v1.11 Phase 63
- ✓ Generic `llm_logs` Postgres table — designed for reuse across future LLM features (18 cols, JSONB, FK CASCADE, 5 indexes, genai-prices cost accounting with `cost_unknown:<model>` soft-fallback) — v1.11 Phase 64

- ✓ Frontend `EndgameInsightsBlock` — parent-lifted mutation state, overview + 4 inline Section blocks, single retry affordance on failure — v1.11 Phase 66
- ✓ Dual-line Endgame vs Non-Endgame Score over Time chart — replaces single-line Score Gap chart with shaded gap fill (green when endgame leads, red when trails); prompt simplified — v1.11 Phase 68
- ✓ Isolated `flawchess-benchmark` PostgreSQL 18 instance on port 5433, deployed via `docker-compose.benchmark.yml` with read-only MCP role, `bin/benchmark_db.sh` lifecycle script, and Alembic-driven schema parity with dev/prod/test (no schema fork) — v1.12 Phase 69
- ✓ Third read-only MCP server `flawchess-benchmark-db` registered and documented in `CLAUDE.md` Database Access section — v1.12 Phase 69
- ✓ Resumable Lichess monthly-dump ingestion pipeline with `zgrep`-streaming eval pre-filter, per-user checkpoint, idempotent inserts via existing `(platform, platform_game_id)` unique constraint, SIGINT + SIGKILL safety — v1.12 Phase 69
- ✓ Stratified subsampling at the player-opportunity level on (rating_bucket × time_control) — 5 buckets × 4 TCs, separate `WhiteElo` / `BlackElo` per side; smoke-validated via `--per-cell 3` ingest of 274k games / 19.4M positions in 3h 6min — v1.12 Phase 69
- ✓ Centipawn convention (signed from white's POV, centipawns vs pawn-units) verified by `tests/test_benchmark_ingest.py::test_centipawn_convention_signed_from_white` running in CI — v1.12 Phase 69
- ✓ Backend `opening_insights_service` with `POST /api/insights/openings` — single SQL transition aggregation per (user, color) over `game_positions` for entry plies in [3, 16], LAG-window CTE + windowed `array_agg` passes `entry_san_sequence` to the service. Strict `>` 0.55 win/loss boundary, `MIN_GAMES_PER_CANDIDATE = 20` evidence floor, severity tier major (≥ 0.60) / minor — v1.13 Phase 70
- ✓ Two-pass attribution with parent-prefix Zobrist lookup (ctypes c_int64 signed-int64 conversion to match polyglot hashes); unmatched findings dropped, never surfaced as `<unnamed line>` placeholders — v1.13 Phase 70
- ✓ Partial composite covering index `ix_gp_user_game_ply` via Alembic `postgresql_concurrently=True` + `autocommit_block` — keeps the LAG-window scan an Index Only Scan with Heap Fetches: 0 at ~9% of `game_positions` size — v1.13 Phase 70
- ✓ Frontend `OpeningInsightsBlock` on Openings → Stats subtab with severity-accented `OpeningFindingCard` (DARK_RED / LIGHT_RED / DARK_GREEN / LIGHT_GREEN from `arrowColor.ts`), shared `LazyMiniBoard` thumbnail, four-state rendering. CI test `test_opening_insights_arrow_consistency` enforces backend/frontend threshold lock-step — v1.13 Phase 71
- ✓ Deep-link wiring — clicking a finding's Moves link replays `entry_san_sequence`, flips the board if needed, applies the matching color filter, navigates to Move Explorer with sticky severity tint + one-shot pulse on the candidate row — v1.13 Phase 71
- ✓ Openings page subnav layout refactor — desktop subnav lifts above `SidebarLayout`; mobile gains a sticky 4-tab subnav with filter button, board becomes non-sticky on Moves/Games and hidden on Stats/Insights, chevron-fold collapsible removed — v1.13 Phase 71.1
- ✓ Score-based opening insights — chess score `(W + 0.5·D)/N` is the canonical metric; effect-size gate against a 0.50 pivot with strict `≤`/`≥` boundaries (minor 0.45/0.55, major 0.40/0.60). Trinomial Wald 95% half-width drives `confidence: "low" | "medium" | "high"` (≤ 0.10 → high, ≤ 0.20 → medium, else low) — actual variance of `X ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}`, not the binomial-Wilson approximation. `loss_rate` / `win_rate` removed from API; `confidence` + `p_value` added to `OpeningInsightFinding` and `NextMoveEntry`. `MIN_GAMES_PER_CANDIDATE` dropped 20 → 10 for discovery framing — v1.14 Phase 75
- ✓ Frontend score-based coloring shipped end-to-end — `arrowColor.ts` migrated (effect-size only, no confidence cue on arrows); Move Explorer moves-list row tint by score with extended mute `(game_count < 10 OR confidence === 'low')`; Conf column with sort key `(confidence DESC, |score - 0.50| DESC)`; `OpeningFindingCard` shows score-based prose with level-specific confidence indicator and directional p-value tooltip; `UNRELIABLE_OPACITY` mute on cards/rows; four `InfoPopover` triggers on `OpeningInsightsBlock` section headers. Mobile parity at 375px. CI consistency test enforces backend/frontend threshold lock-step. PR #71 inline hotfix forces grey arrow + skips row tint when `confidence === 'low'` — v1.14 Phase 76
- ✓ Troll-opening watermark — `troll-face.svg` renders as 30%-opacity bottom-right watermark on `OpeningFindingCard` (mobile + desktop) and a small inline icon next to qualifying SAN rows in `MoveExplorer` (desktop only via `hidden sm:inline-block`). Frontend-only matching via side-only FEN piece-placement key (no backend schema, no Zobrist hash, no API contract change); curation via Node/TS script with per-ply emission for human pruning. Decorative `<img>` idiom (`alt=""` + `aria-hidden="true"`, `pointer-events-none`) — v1.14 Phase 77
- ✓ Endgame conv/recov classification migrated from material-imbalance + 4-ply persistence proxy to direct Stockfish-eval thresholding (±100 cp on `eval_cp`, color-flipped to user perspective; `eval_mate` short-circuits to ±1,000,000 cp). Hard cutover, proxy code path removed entirely. Closes the structural gap on Queen and pawnless classes — v1.15 Phase 78
- ✓ Pinned Stockfish in backend Docker image (sf_17 → sf_18 with SHA-256 supply-chain verification); `app/services/engine.py` async wrapper with FastAPI lifespan integration; `scripts/backfill_eval.py` idempotent + resumable CLI driver with `--workers N` parallel evaluation via `EnginePool` — v1.15 Phase 78
- ✓ Import-time eval pass: per-class span-entry rows + middlegame entry row populated on every new import in `_flush_batch`, same transaction. Adds well under 1s to the typical-game import path. Module-level `EnginePool` of `STOCKFISH_POOL_SIZE` workers (prod ships 2) parallelises the eval pass via `asyncio.gather` — v1.15 Phase 78 + PR #79
- ✓ Alembic `c92af8282d1a` reshapes `ix_gp_user_endgame_game INCLUDE` from `material_imbalance` to `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` so endgame queries stay index-only. `_classify_endgame_bucket(eval_cp, eval_mate, user_color)` is the single classification helper — v1.15 Phase 78
- ✓ Per-position `phase` SmallInteger column on `game_positions` (0=opening, 1=middlegame, 2=endgame) computed via Python port of [lichess `Divider.scala`](https://github.com/lichess-org/scalachess/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/Divider.scala) using existing `piece_count`, `backrank_sparse`, `mixedness` inputs. 11 Divider parity tests lock output to lichess reference. Populated on every new import and backfilled across benchmark + prod (Alembic `1efcc66a7695`) — v1.15 Phase 79
- ✓ Middlegame entry position (`MIN(ply)` of `phase = 1` per game) Stockfish-evaluated at depth 15 alongside endgame span-entry positions, populated into the same `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` columns. Substrate for v1.16 opening-stats analyses — v1.15 Phase 79
- ✓ Opening Stats subtab — avg eval at middlegame entry ± std (user POV) with one-sample t-test confidence pill (`compute_eval_confidence_bucket`) and CI-whisker MiniBulletChart, on bookmarked + most-played tables. Later restructured into a two-column card grid via quick task 260506-rtk that replaced MostPlayedOpeningsTable — v1.16 Phase 80
- ✓ Move Explorer + Opening Insights WDL/score/confidence/p_value now reflect resulting-position (transposition-inclusive). `query_transposition_wdl` + `query_resulting_position_wdl` repo helpers; `game_count` and the n≥10 surfacing gate stay move-played for honest disclosure — v1.16 Phase 80.1
- ✓ Endgame Start vs End twin-tile section above the WDL table: entry-eval (cp, Wald-z sig-tested vs 0) + endgame score (Wilson score test vs 50%), three-state color, n≥10 gate, "we can't tell" framing for non-significant verdicts. `EndgamePerformanceResponse` gains `entry_eval_mean_pawns`, `entry_eval_n`, `entry_eval_p_value`, `entry_eval_ci_low_pawns`, `entry_eval_ci_high_pawns`, `endgame_score_p_value` — v1.16 Phase 81
- ✓ LLM endgame-insights prompt awareness of Start vs End metrics — `MetricId` + `SubsectionId` Literal extensions, `ZONE_REGISTRY` entries for `entry_eval_pawns` (band ±0.5 after D-08 tightening) + `endgame_score` (band [0.45, 0.55]); prompt version `endgame_v23` → `endgame_v24` — v1.16 Phase 82
- ✓ Stockfish-baseline predicted endgame score — `eval_cp_to_expected_score` (Lichess sigmoid k=0.00368208) + `eval_mate_to_expected_score`; 5 new `EndgamePerformanceResponse` fields (`entry_expected_score`, `_n`, `_p_value`, `_ci_low`, `_ci_high`); 2x2 grid restructure of Start vs End (Where you start + What you do with it × Stockfish baseline + your achieved); LLM prompt `endgame_v25` → `endgame_v26` narrates achievable-vs-achieved gap as headline diagnostic. Closes SEED-014 — v1.16 Phase 83

### Active (v1.17 — Endgame Stats Card Redesign)

**Goal:** Replace three table-driven sections on the Endgames page with the established WDL + ScoreBullet card pattern from `EndgameStartVsEndSection.tsx` / `OpeningStatsCard.tsx`, so gauge and bullet tell one coherent population-relative story while a second peer bullet preserves the self-calibrating "vs your actual opponents" signal.

**Target features (source: `.planning/notes/endgame-stats-card-redesign.md`):**

- Section 1 — Games with vs without Endgame: two side-by-side cards (No / Yes) each with WDL bar + Score row + cohort score bullet vs 50%, plus a full-width Score Gap footer bullet (Yes − No vs 0). Replaces `EndgamePerformanceSection`.
- Section 2 — Endgame Metrics: 4 cards (Conversion, Parity, Recovery, Skill). Conv/Parity/Recov share an identical layout: gauge → percent → WDL → cohort bullet vs p50 → peer bullet (`You − Opp` vs 0). Skill card has no WDL bar and no peer bullet. Replaces `EndgameScoreGapSection` table + 4-gauge strip.
- Section 3 — Endgame Type Breakdown: 5 per-type cards (rook, minor_piece, pawn, queen, mixed). Each card has side-by-side Conv + Recov gauges, WDL bar, Conv cohort + peer bullets, Recov cohort + peer bullets, and a Games link. Removes grouped `EndgameWDLChart`; extends `EndgameConvRecovChart` into full cards.

**Key design properties:**

- **Two-bullet doctrine on Conv/Parity/Recov + Section 3 per-type cards:** cohort bullet vs global p50 (population frame, Wilson sig) + peer bullet vs 0 on `You − Opp` (filter-responsive self-calibrating frame, Wald-z sig). Reuses existing `MIRROR_BUCKET` / `MIN_OPPONENT_BASELINE_GAMES` mirror logic.
- **Accepted property of the cohort frame:** p50 anchors from `reports/benchmarks-2026-05-10.md` §171-177 are pooled across all rating × TC cells. Verdict is rating-tier signal mixed with within-tier skill. Document in popover; cell-specific cohort baselines deferred. Peer bullet partially compensates with a tier-independent read.
- **Parity peer bullet is statistically redundant** with its cohort bullet at p50 = 0.500 (kept for v1.17 layout uniformity; revisit after build).
- **Mobile-density fallback on Section 3:** if real-device testing reveals scroll bloat, peer bullets are the first to drop on Section 3.

**Out of scope for v1.17:**

- Backend changes — all stats (Conv/Parity/Recov rates, cohort bands, WDL aggregates, score-gap, per-type, mirror-bucket rates) already exist on the response schema.
- New statistical methods — reuses existing Wilson CI / p-value / `scoreConfidence` / `wilsonBounds` / `computeScoreConfidence` infra.
- Benchmark refresh — uses the existing 2026-05-10 percentile table.
- Cell-specific (rating × TC) cohort baselines — deferred to a future benchmarks pass.

### Deferred (gated on full benchmark ingest — SEED-006)

- [ ] Classifier validation replication at 10–100x scale (Phase B gate)
- [ ] Rating-stratified material-vs-eval offset analysis
- [ ] Parity proxy validation against Stockfish eval
- [ ] `/benchmarks` skill upgrade — population baselines and rating-bucketed zone thresholds applied to `frontend/src/lib/theme.ts`

### Out of Scope

- Manual PGN file upload — API import only
- In-app game viewer — link to chess.com/lichess instead
- Human-like engine analysis — future: engine evaluation filtered by human move plausibility at target Elo (see Maia Chess approach)
- Offline API data caching — chess data is user-specific + authenticated; caching risks stale analysis
- Swipe-to-navigate between tabs — conflicts with chessboard touch gestures
- Material configuration filter for endgames — deferred to future milestone

## Current State

v1.16 Stockfish Eval Analyses shipped 2026-05-11 — 5 phases (80, 80.1, 81, 82, 83), 24 plans, 118 commits over 7 days, delivered via PRs #80, #82, #85, #86, #88. Sixteen milestones complete (v1.0–v1.16), 80 phases (+5 inserted: 27.1, 28.1, 41.1, 57.1, 71.1, plus mid-milestone 80.1), live at flawchess.com.

The Endgame Start vs End section above the Endgame Overall Performance WDL table is now a 2×2 grid: rows are "Where you start" (entry eval, in pawns) and "What you do with it" (achieved endgame score); columns are Stockfish baseline (predicted via Lichess sigmoid `1/(1+exp(-k·cp))`, k=0.00368208) and the user's measured value. Each tile carries a sig-tested verdict (Wald-z for entry eval vs 0; Wilson for endgame_score vs 50%; Wilson for entry_expected_score vs achieved endgame_score) with three-state color and `n ≥ 10` reliability gate; mobile stacks chronologically setup → execution. LLM narration (`endgame_v26`) frames the achievable-vs-achieved gap as the headline diagnostic and uses tightened cohort bands (entry_eval_pawns ±0.5; endgame_score [0.45, 0.55]) so borderline-but-significant findings land in `zone="typical"` and stay silent. The aggregation runs against `query_endgame_bucket_rows` (one row per game, eval at chronologically first endgame position) so `entry_eval_n + mate_excluded + null_excluded == endgame_wdl.total` by construction.

Phase 80 ships the Opening Stats subtab eval column with t-test confidence pill and CI-whisker MiniBulletChart on both bookmarked and most-played tables; the table layout was later replaced by a two-column card grid in quick task `260506-rtk`. Phase 80.1 swapped WDL/score/confidence/p_value on Move Explorer rows and Opening Insights findings from move-played to resulting-position (transposition-inclusive) via the new `query_transposition_wdl` + `query_resulting_position_wdl` repo helpers; `game_count` and the n≥10 surfacing gate stay move-played for honest disclosure. SEED-014 (Stockfish-baseline expected score for endgame entries) closed by Phase 83; follow-up gap-as-first-class-metric work tracked in SEED-015.

v1.15 replaced the material-imbalance + 4-ply persistence proxy for endgame conversion / parity / recovery classification with direct Stockfish-eval thresholding (±100 cp on `eval_cp` after color-sign flip; `eval_mate` short-circuits to ±1,000,000 cp). Hard cutover — `_MATERIAL_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD`, `PERSISTENCE_PLIES`, and the `array_agg(... ORDER BY ply)[PERSISTENCE_PLIES + 1]` contiguity case-expression deleted from the codebase. `material_imbalance` column retained for other consumers. Closes the structural gap on Queen and pawnless classes where the proxy underperformed (~24% miss rate on substantive material-edge sequences per the 2026-05-02 baseline). Stockfish is shipped via a pinned binary in the backend Docker image (sf_17 → sf_18 with SHA-256 supply-chain verification); `app/services/engine.py` is the single async wrapper consumed by both `scripts/backfill_eval.py` and the import path. Module-level `EnginePool` of `STOCKFISH_POOL_SIZE` workers (prod ships 2) parallelises the import-time eval pass via `asyncio.gather`. Alembic `c92af8282d1a` reshapes `ix_gp_user_endgame_game INCLUDE` from `material_imbalance` to `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` so endgame queries stay index-only. `_classify_endgame_bucket(eval_cp, eval_mate, user_color)` is the single classification helper.

Phase 79 added a per-position `phase` SmallInteger column on `game_positions` (0=opening, 1=middlegame, 2=endgame) computed via Python port of lichess `Divider.scala` using existing `piece_count`, `backrank_sparse`, `mixedness` inputs (no second board scan). 11 Divider-sourced parity assertions lock output to the lichess reference on a curated FEN fixture set. The middlegame-entry position (`MIN(ply)` of `phase = 1` per game) is also Stockfish-evaluated at depth 15 alongside endgame span-entry positions, populated into the same `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` columns. The combined Phase 78 + Phase 79 backfill ran on benchmark first, then prod, in a single operator cutover (D-79-10) — substrate now in place for v1.16 opening-stats analyses.

VAL-01 / PHASE-VAL-01 (re-run `/conv-recov-validation` post-backfill for ~100% agreement) were rescinded as moot once REFAC-03 deleted the proxy code path: agreement metric becomes undefined when there's only one classifier. The `/conv-recov-validation` skill was deleted on 2026-05-03.

Inline quick tasks during the milestone window: 260501-s0u rebuilt the endgame UI from a benchmark report (clock-pressure neutral band ±10pp → ±5pp; recovery typical band [25%, 35%] → [25%, 40%]; six per-class Conversion/Recovery mini-gauges replaced the grouped WDL bar chart; LLM endgame insights prompt v18 reframes Conv/Recov as delta-from-class-baseline). 260503 recalibrated gauge typical bands from the 2026-05-03 benchmark report. 260503-fef applied an equal-footing opponent filter (`abs(opp_rating - user_rating) ≤ 100`) to the `/benchmarks` skill so population baselines reflect peer-vs-peer matchups.

v1.14 Score-Based Opening Insights shipped 2026-04-29 (PRs #69, #70, #71, #72, #73).

v1.14 folded SEED-007 Option A (Wilson on score, 0.50 pivot, no user-baseline) and SEED-008 (label reframe + confidence cues) under a single calibrated framing. Score `(W + 0.5·D)/N` is the canonical metric across `opening_insights_service.py`, `openings_repository.py`, `arrowColor.ts`, and the `NextMoveEntry` / `OpeningInsightFinding` API payloads. Effect-size gate against a 0.50 pivot with strict `≤`/`≥` boundaries (minor 0.45/0.55, major 0.40/0.60). Trinomial Wald 95% half-width — using the actual variance of the chess result distribution `X ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}`, not the binomial-Wilson approximation that over-states uncertainty when draws are common — drives the `confidence: "low" | "medium" | "high"` badge surfaced on Insights cards and Move Explorer moves-list rows. `loss_rate` / `win_rate` removed cleanly; `severity` retained alongside the new `confidence` and `p_value` fields. `MIN_GAMES_PER_CANDIDATE` dropped 20 → 10 to enable discovery framing; the badge calibrates trust where the hard floor used to gate. The conceptual pivot is "effect size decides what shows up, confidence annotates how sure we are" — the right inversion for a discovery UI.

Frontend shipped end-to-end with mobile parity at 375px: arrows colored by score (effect-size only, no confidence cue on arrows); moves-list row tint by score with extended mute `(game_count < 10 OR confidence === 'low')`; new Conf column with sort key `(confidence DESC, |score - 0.50| DESC)`; `OpeningFindingCard` shows score-based prose with level-specific confidence indicator and directional p-value tooltip; `UNRELIABLE_OPACITY` mute on cards/rows; four `InfoPopover` triggers on `OpeningInsightsBlock` section headers. PR #71 inline hotfix forces grey arrow + skips row tint when `confidence === 'low'`, strengthening the at-a-glance board read. INSIGHT-UI-04 (soften titles per SEED-008) descoped 2026-04-28 per Phase 76 D-04: severity word never appeared as user-facing text; confidence badge + sort calibration deliver SEED-008's intent without rewriting "Weakness/Strength" titles.

Phase 77 added a troll-opening watermark — frontend-only matching via a side-only FEN piece-placement key (no backend schema, no Zobrist hash, no API contract change). `troll-face.svg` renders as 30%-opacity bottom-right watermark on `OpeningFindingCard` (mobile + desktop) and a small inline icon next to qualifying SAN rows in `MoveExplorer` (desktop only via `hidden sm:inline-block`). Curation is offline via a Node/TS script that emits per-ply candidates (both colors) for human pruning. Decorative `<img>` idiom (`alt=""` + `aria-hidden="true"`, `pointer-events-none`) keeps the asset cacheable and out of the accessibility tree.

LLM narration of opening insights remains deferred — v1.14 shipped the calibrated data plumbing (effect size + confidence + p_value) that future LLM narration would consume. Population-relative weakness signals stay gated on full benchmark ingest (SEED-006).

<summary>Previous milestone snapshots (v1.13, v1.12)</summary>

v1.13 Opening Insights shipped 2026-04-27 (PRs #66, #67, #68). v1.13 fulfilled SEED-005 with a templated/rule-based opening-insights pipeline. Backend `opening_insights_service` scans every (entry_position, candidate_move) pair across entry plies [3, 16] via a single LAG-window CTE per (user, color) over `game_positions`, deduplicates by Zobrist hash with deepest-opening attribution, applies an `n ≥ 20` evidence floor and a strict `>` 0.55 win/loss boundary, and emits `OpeningInsightFinding[]` with `entry_san_sequence` so the frontend can replay the line on demand. Frontend `OpeningInsightsBlock` on Openings → Stats renders severity-accented per-finding cards with deep-links into the Move Explorer pre-positioned at the entry FEN. Phase 71.1 refactored the Openings page subnav to match the Endgames pattern. Mid-milestone scope-down on 2026-04-27 dropped Phases 72/73/74. v1.13 deliberately did NOT consume the v1.12 benchmark DB — opening positions are book theory.

v1.12 Benchmark DB Infrastructure & Ingestion Pipeline shipped 2026-04-26 (PR #65). v1.12 delivered the operational half of SEED-002: a separate `flawchess-benchmark` PostgreSQL 18 instance on port 5433, a third read-only MCP server (`flawchess-benchmark-db`), Alembic-driven schema parity with dev/prod/test (no fork), a streaming `zgrep` eval pre-filter, a stratified subsampling pipeline at the player-opportunity level on (rating × TC) with separate `WhiteElo`/`BlackElo` per side, and a SIGINT/SIGKILL-resumable per-user checkpoint orchestrator. Smoke-validated end-to-end via a `--per-cell 3` ingest of 274k games / 19.4M positions in 3h 6min. Scoped down on 2026-04-26 from 5 phases (69-73) to 1 (69); Phases 70-73 moved to SEED-006. Hot-patch dropped `games.eval_depth` + `games.eval_source_version` after the smoke confirmed Lichess's `/api/games/user` emits bare `[%eval cp]` with no depth field.

## Context

- **Current state:** v1.13 shipped 2026-04-27. 70 phases complete across 13 milestones. Live at flawchess.com with CI/CD and Sentry.
- **Stack:** FastAPI + React 19/TS/Vite 5 + PostgreSQL + python-chess + TanStack Query + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (Command, Popover)
- **Auth:** FastAPI-Users (JWT + Google SSO + guest sessions with is_guest flag + impersonation via ClaimAwareJWTStrategy)
- **Core algorithm:** Zobrist hashes (white_hash, black_hash, full_hash) precomputed at import for indexed integer equality lookups
- **PWA:** vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox (NetworkOnly for API routes), vaul drawer, tailwindcss-safe-area
- **Analytics:** Consolidated `/api/endgames/overview` serves every endgame chart in one round trip on a single AsyncSession; deferred filter apply on desktop (matches mobile)
- **LLM stack (v1.11):** pydantic-ai Agent with env-var-driven model selection (`PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL_INSIGHTS`), `genai-prices` for cost accounting, generic `llm_logs` Postgres table as prompt-engineering harness
- **Benchmark DB (v1.12):** separate PostgreSQL 18 instance on port 5433 (`docker-compose.benchmark.yml`), shares canonical Alembic chain with dev/prod/test, benchmark-only ops tables (`benchmark_selected_users`, `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints`) created via `Base.metadata.create_all()` against the benchmark engine on first invocation
- **Known issues:** react-chessboard v5 arrow clearing workaround (clearArrowsOnPositionChange: false), BoardArrow local type definition, touch drag disabled (click-to-move only on mobile), Phase 60/61 have incomplete SUMMARY.md artifacts (no functional impact); pre-existing ORM/DB column drift (`game_positions.clock_seconds`, `games.white_accuracy`, `games.black_accuracy` REAL→Float) on every Alembic autogenerate — deferred cleanup migration outstanding

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Python backend (FastAPI), uv for package management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with asyncpg — must support efficient position-based queries across thousands of games
- **Deployment**: Must work locally and be deployable to a server
- **Libraries**: Use established open-source libraries (python-chess, etc.) rather than reinventing
- **HTTP client**: httpx async only — never use requests or berserk

| Deferred filter apply on desktop | Matches existing mobile pattern; avoids query storm | ✓ Good |
| 4-ply persistence + 100cp conv/recov threshold | Reduces transient-capture noise; validated against Stockfish eval | ✓ Good |
| Opponent-based self-calibrating baseline | Replaces global-average with opponent's rate against the user | ✓ Good |
| Skill-adjusted Endgame ELO formula | actual_elo + 400·log10(skill/(1-skill)); not performance rating | ✓ Good |
| Asof-join anchor on user's real rating | Fixes rolling-mean lag that confused "actual" terminology | ✓ Good |
| Weekly volume bars on timeline charts | Visual weight indicator per weekly point | ✓ Good |
| Single auth_backend + ClaimAwareJWTStrategy | Zero changes to existing Depends(current_active_user) call sites | ✓ Good |
| Truncate flawchess_test at pytest session start | Enables deterministic integer assertions via seeded_user fixture | ✓ Good |
| Split time_control into base_time + increment | Time pressure % denominator per-game base time, clamped at 2x | ✓ Good |
| pydantic-ai Agent with provider-agnostic model env var | `PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL_INSIGHTS` lets model swap without code changes; startup fails fast on missing/invalid | ✓ Good |
| System prompt in file (`app/prompts/endgame_insights.md`), not string literal | Versioned, diff-readable, bumping `_PROMPT_VERSION` is the cache-invalidation handle | ✓ Good |
| Generic `llm_logs` table, not `insights_llm_logs` | Designed up-front to host every future LLM feature; `endpoint` column distinguishes consumers | ✓ Good |
| Findings-hash cache + 3-miss/hr/user rate limit with soft-fail | Equivalent filter states reuse cached report; over-limit returns last cached rather than error | ✓ Good |
| Shared zone registry + Python→TS codegen with CI drift guard | Narrative and chart visuals agree by construction; no two-sided drift | ✓ Good |
| Parent-lifted mutation state for EndgameInsightsBlock (no Context) | `useEndgameInsights` in Endgames.tsx; block + 4 slot instances observe same state | ✓ Good |
| Dual-line Score chart over single-line Score Gap chart | Makes endgame-vs-non-endgame composition self-evident; eliminated the prompt's score_gap framing rule | ✓ Good |
| Phase 67 descope — rollout to all users instead of beta cohort | Fast learning from real telemetry; tradeoff: no automated regression guard against prompt changes | — Pending (snapshot test deferred to pre-v1.13) |
| Separate `flawchess-benchmark` Postgres instance, not a schema in dev/prod | Isolation from prod; safe to wipe and reseed; second MCP server with read-only role keeps the analysis interactive | ✓ Good |
| Same canonical Alembic chain as dev/prod/test (no schema fork) | Lichess `[%eval` populates the existing `game_positions.eval_cp`/`eval_mate` columns; no benchmark-only games / game_positions variant to maintain | ✓ Good |
| Benchmark-only ops tables via `Base.metadata.create_all()` | `benchmark_selected_users` and `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints` exist solely to drive the orchestrator; carving them out of Alembic keeps the analytical schema clean | ✓ Good |
| Streaming `zgrep` eval pre-filter before python-chess | Drops the ~85% of dump games without `[%eval` headers an order of magnitude faster than structural parsing | ✓ Good |
| Player-side bucketing on `WhiteElo` / `BlackElo` separately | Each side belongs to its own rating cell; aggregations over `game_positions` never roll up by a single game-level rating field | ✓ Good |
| Per-user checkpoint table + idempotent `(platform, platform_game_id)` inserts | SIGINT/SIGKILL-resumable without dedup logic at the application layer; duplicates blocked by the existing unique constraint | ✓ Good |
| v1.12 scope-down to Phase 69 only (Phases 70-73 → SEED-006) | Full benchmark ingest is days of wall-clock ops work, not a milestone gate; treating it as one was blocking unrelated work like v1.13 opening insights | ✓ Good |
| Smoke-from-`--per-cell 3` over interim `--per-cell 30` ingest | Pipeline-correctness evidence collected from a small smoke run rather than blocking on a multi-day full ingest; aligns with the scope-down framing | ✓ Good |
| Hot-patch drop of `eval_depth` + `eval_source_version` mid-Phase 69 | Post-smoke sampling proved both columns were dead (Lichess API emits bare `[%eval cp]` with no depth field); lighter than running a corrective phase | ✓ Good |
| Single SQL transition aggregation per (user, color) over `game_positions` | LAG-window CTE on `(user_id, game_id, ply)` index streams transitions without re-sort; HAVING enforces evidence floor and threshold at SQL level — no Python-side post-filter | ✓ Good |
| `entry_san_sequence` via `array_agg` window with `BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING` | Frontend can replay the line on the chessboard without a separate roundtrip; sequence is "everything before the entry move" by construction | ✓ Good |
| Strict `>` 0.55 win/loss boundary mirroring `frontend/src/lib/arrowColor.ts` | CI test `test_opening_insights_arrow_consistency` asserts threshold lock-step; eliminates classifier/visual divergence | ✓ Good |
| Severity tier `major (≥ 0.60) / minor (>0.55, <0.60)` with arrowColor border mapping | Severity becomes a visual axis (DARK_RED / LIGHT_RED / DARK_GREEN / LIGHT_GREEN) consistent with arrow stroke colors | ✓ Good |
| Two-pass attribution (direct + parent-prefix lookup) with drop-on-miss | Avoids `<unnamed line>` placeholders; ctypes c_int64 conversion required to match python-chess polyglot signed-int64 hashes (BLOCKER-2) | ✓ Good |
| `MIN_GAMES_PER_CANDIDATE = 20` as `MIN_GAMES_PER_CANDIDATE` (was n=10 in original spec) | n=10 was too noisy in real-world testing; n=20 settles WDL into a believable rate before classification | ✓ Good |
| Bookmarks NOT consumed as algorithmic input | Bookmarks remain a UI feature for explicit user tracking; opening insights operate on actual play frequency, not curated picks | ✓ Good |
| Constants in tiny `opening_insights_constants.py` module (16 lines) | Avoids circular import between repository (uses constants in SQL) and service (uses constants in classification) | ✓ Good |
| Repository owns module-level threshold constants, service re-exports | Single source of truth on the SQL boundary; constants colocate with the queries that embed them | ✓ Good |
| Partial composite covering index `ix_gp_user_game_ply` with `INCLUDE (full_hash, move_san)` | Index Only Scan with Heap Fetches: 0; partial predicate `ply BETWEEN 1 AND 17` keeps the index ~9% of `game_positions` size | ✓ Good |
| First project use of `postgresql_concurrently=True` + `autocommit_block` | Required for index creation on a write-heavy table without locking out import; rationale captured inline so future autogenerate doesn't reorder columns | ✓ Good |
| `LazyMiniBoard` extracted from inline `GameCard` function into shared `frontend/src/components/board/` module | Reused by `OpeningFindingCard` (deep-link card) and the future Insights bookmark surfaces; IntersectionObserver lazy render preserved byte-for-byte | ✓ Good |
| Single `<a href>` whole-card touch target on `OpeningFindingCard` | Originally split, then collapsed to the whole card; reverted in quick-task 260427-h3u to explicit "Moves" + "Games" links because the whole-card target obscured which subtab opened | ⚠️ Revisit (link semantics may evolve) |
| Phase 71.1 inserted mid-milestone (Openings subnav refactor to match Endgames pattern) | Frontend layout debt surfaced during Phase 71 UAT; cheaper to fix in-milestone than carry the diverging desktop/mobile shapes into v1.14 | ✓ Good |
| v1.13 scope-down to Phases 70+71+71.1 (72/73/74 descoped) | Move Explorer row tint already conveys the signal at the displayed position; per-finding cards already deliver per-opening actionable signal at finer granularity than an aggregate; bookmark-badge density risked alert fatigue | ✓ Good |
| Templated/rule-based v1, no LLM | Defer LLM narration until templated findings are in real users' hands and we know which findings are worth narrating; v1.11 LLM stack remains available for v1.13.x or v1.14 | ✓ Good |
| v1.13 deliberately does NOT consume v1.12 benchmark DB | Opening positions are book theory (engine eval ≈ 0.0); absolute under-/over-performance over n ≥ 20 is actionable without population baselines per SEED-005 § Why Self-Referential Is Sufficient | ✓ Good |
| Score `(W + 0.5·D)/N` replaces loss/win rate as the canonical metric | One number drives classification, color, and badge; `severity`/`confidence`/`p_value` are derived layers on top. Eliminates the `loss_rate > 0.55` asymmetry of v1.13 | ✓ Good |
| Trinomial Wald 95% half-width (variance `(W + 0.25·D)/N − score²`) over binomial Wilson | Chess result distribution `X ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}` is trinomial; binomial Wilson over-states uncertainty when draws are common. Standard formula in BayesElo / Ordo. Pure-Python `math` only, no scipy | ✓ Good |
| Strict `≤` / `≥` boundaries on score and half-width thresholds | Eliminates ambiguity at the boundary; constants live in `opening_insights_constants.py` for retunability | ✓ Good |
| API exposes both `confidence` (badge) and `p_value` (tooltip) | Frontend renders effect size (severity) + precision (confidence) + significance (tooltip) per finding without overloading any one cue | ✓ Good |
| `MIN_GAMES_PER_CANDIDATE` 20 → 10 for discovery framing | Confidence badge replaces hard-floor gate; surfaces low-confidence candidates as discovery signal rather than filtering them out | ✓ Good |
| Sort key `(confidence DESC, |score - 0.50| DESC)` | High-confidence findings rise within each severity bucket; effect-size is within-confidence tiebreak | ✓ Good |
| INSIGHT-UI-04 descoped (no title rewrite per SEED-008) | Severity word never appeared as user-facing text (only drove border color); confidence badge + sort carry SEED-008 intent without rewriting "Weakness/Strength" titles | ✓ Good |
| Force grey arrow + skip row tint when `confidence === 'low'` (PR #71, post-Phase 76 inline hotfix) | Board reads cleaner; low-confidence findings still surface in the table with the badge but don't visually claim authority on the board | ✓ Good |
| Single `compute_confidence_bucket` shared module + CI structural assertion | One implementation, asserted by CI; `opening_insights_service` and the move-explorer payload both consume it; CI consistency test enforces backend/frontend threshold lock-step | ✓ Good |
| Troll-opening matching frontend-only via side-only FEN piece-placement key | No backend schema / Zobrist hash / API contract change. Small read-only curated set; lookup once per finding render | ✓ Good |
| Per-ply emission (both colors) in curation script | Pushes ambiguity into human review step instead of guessing at "the defining position" of an opening | ✓ Good |
| Decorative `<img>` watermark with `alt=""` + `aria-hidden="true"` + `pointer-events-none` | Asset stays cacheable, browser handles scaling, kept out of accessibility tree, doesn't block underlying interactive elements | ✓ Good |
| Phase 77 added off-roadmap-scope under v1.14 | Frontend-only follow-on with no v1.15 dependency; cheaper to ship under v1.14 than open a hyphenated milestone | ✓ Good |
| Hard cutover for endgame classification (v1.15 REFAC-03) | Removed the proxy code path entirely rather than running both side-by-side. The validation report had already established the proxy's structural ceiling on queen + pawnless classes; a fallback would have re-introduced the failure mode for any game without lichess `%eval` annotation | ✓ Good |
| `_classify_endgame_bucket(eval_cp, eval_mate, user_color)` as single classification helper | SQL projects raw white-perspective eval; service layer applies user-color sign flip. Mate scores short-circuit to ±1,000,000 cp so the same threshold handles both | ✓ Good |
| Pinned Stockfish binary in backend Docker image with SHA-256 verification | Supply-chain verification on a binary that runs as a long-lived UCI process — not a per-call subprocess fork. CI runner installs `stockfish` via apt so engine wrapper tests run | ✓ Good |
| Module-level `EnginePool` over per-call engine spawn | Parallelises the import-time eval pass via `asyncio.gather` with `STOCKFISH_POOL_SIZE` workers; sequential callers see no change. Default 1 outside prod, prod ships 2 via `docker-compose.yml` | ✓ Good |
| FILL-02 relaxed mid-plan (drop `full_hash` dedup) | Row-level idempotency only via `WHERE eval_cp IS NULL AND eval_mate IS NULL`. Hash dedup added complexity for marginal CPU savings on a one-shot backfill | ✓ Good |
| `phase` SmallInteger column via Python port of lichess `Divider.scala` | Reuses existing `piece_count`, `backrank_sparse`, `mixedness` per-position fields — no second python-chess board scan. 11 Divider parity tests lock output to the lichess reference | ✓ Good |
| Combined Phase 78 + Phase 79 operator cutover (D-79-10) | Single benchmark + prod backfill pass, single PR #78, single deploy. Saved an operational round-trip and consolidated the deployment risk window | ✓ Good |
| VAL-01 / PHASE-VAL-01 rescinded as moot post-cutover | The `/conv-recov-validation` skill compared proxy vs eval on the populated subset; once the proxy was deleted, the agreement metric became undefined. Skill deleted 2026-05-03 | ✓ Good |
| Endgame UI calibration shipped as inline quick tasks (260501-s0u, 260503), not a separate phase | v1.15 milestone scope was strictly backend; UI gauge recalibration ran inline against the new benchmark report rather than blocking the cutover | ✓ Good |
| Mid-milestone Phase 80.1 inserted (transposition WDL fix) | The 57%→61% mismatch surfaced during Phase 80 UAT was a loud UX bug; cheaper to fix in-milestone than carry into v1.17 | ✓ Good |
| `entry_eval_n` aggregated against `query_endgame_bucket_rows`, not per-class entry_rows (Phase 81 D-22) | UAT against user 28 surfaced a ~5-game under-count when summing per-class entry rows; bucket_rows gives one row per game at chronologically first endgame position, locking `n + mate + null == total` by construction | ✓ Good |
| Cohort band on `entry_eval_pawns` tightened IQR ±0.75 → ±0.5 (Phase 82 D-08) | Avoids over-narrating small-but-significant findings; the user-28 pattern now correctly lands in `zone="typical"` and stays silent on both tile and LLM | ✓ Good |
| No `verdict` field on `SubsectionFinding` (Phase 82 D-06, Phase 83 D-19) | Significance independent of cohort would license LLM over-narration; tighten cohort band instead — matches memory `feedback_llm_significance_signal.md` | ✓ Good |
| Lichess sigmoid k=0.00368208 for eval → expected score (Phase 83) | Same constant Lichess uses to color their eval bars; established mapping, no need to retune. `eval_mate` short-circuits to ±1.0 expected score | ✓ Good |
| 2x2 grid restructure of Start vs End over inserting a third tile (Phase 83) | Stockfish baseline + user achieved now share the same units (W+0.5D ∈ [0,1]) and same visual idiom; the achievable-vs-achieved gap is visually readable instead of requiring LLM prose to translate centipawns → score | ✓ Good |
| Forbidden-word guarding in prompt assets via regression test scanning the prompt file (Phase 83) | Single source of truth: any narration-guidance line using a forbidden term fails CI before the prompt ships | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state

*Last updated: 2026-05-19 — v1.17 in progress. Phase 88.4 (Time Pressure card layout refactor) complete: SC-1 responsive card grid (1/2/3/4-card grid constants in `EndgameTimePressureSection`), SC-2 3-stat "Remaining Time at Endgame Entry" header row (`ClockGapHeaderRow` You/Gap+info/Opp) above the Clock Gap bullet, SC-3 new self-contained `ScoreGapByTimePressureChart` (zone-banded 0-centered line chart + CI whiskers + hover tooltip) replacing the four stacked per-bucket bullets; per-bucket info icons removed. Verified 3/3 must-haves (569 frontend tests green, knip/tsc clean); WR-01 chart-tooltip `text-xs`→`text-sm` fixed per user; 3 in-browser visual UAT items pending in 88.4-HUMAN-UAT.md. Frontend-only, not yet shipped (no PR). Phase 88.3 (Endgame Stats viz refinements) complete: SC-1 inactivity-gap annotations, SC-2 ELO Timeline single-most-active default, SC-3 Overall Performance 2-column card, SC-4 lucide Palmtree break glyph + shared `inactivityGapReferenceLines` helper rolled out to all 6 ordinal-axis timeline charts (verified 13/13 must-haves, status human_needed — 4 visual UAT items, user-approved). v1.17 remaining: Phase 89 (Polish). Prior v1.17 footer note (Phase 84 / two-bullet→single-peer pivot) still applies for the Conv/Parity/Recov doctrine.*

*Previous: 2026-05-12 — v1.17 (Endgame Stats Card Redesign) opened. Frontend-only refactor (with Phase 84 as the lone backend touch) replacing 3 table-driven sections on the Endgames page with the WDL+ScoreBullet card pattern.*

*Previous: 2026-05-11 after v1.16 milestone — Stockfish Eval Analyses shipped (PRs #80, #82, #85, #86, #88). 5 phases (80, 80.1, 81, 82, 83), 24 plans, 118 commits in 7 days. SEED-014 closed by Phase 83; SEED-015 (predicted-vs-achieved gap as first-class metric) remains dormant.*

*Previous: 2026-05-09 — Phase 81 (Endgame Start vs End twin-tile section) complete. UAT against user 28 surfaced D-22 amendment switching entry-eval source from per-class entry_rows to game-level bucket_rows, eliminating a ~5-game under-count and locking the n + mate + null + total invariant by construction.*
