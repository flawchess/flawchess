# Chessalytics

## What This Is

FlawChess (formerly Chessalytics) — a multi-user chess analysis platform that lets players import their games from chess.com and lichess, then analyze win/draw/loss rates for specific board positions. It solves the problem of inconsistent opening categorization on existing platforms — instead of relying on opening names, users define positions visually and filter by actual piece placement. Includes an interactive move explorer showing next moves with W/D/L stats per position. Works as an installable PWA on mobile with touch-optimized UI.

## Core Value

Users can determine their success rate for any opening position they specify, filtering by their own pieces only, regardless of how platforms categorize the opening.

## Requirements

### Active

<!-- v1.3 Project Launch — see REQUIREMENTS.md for full breakdown -->

### Out of Scope

- Manual PGN file upload — API import only
- In-app game viewer — link to chess.com/lichess instead
- Human-like engine analysis — future: engine evaluation filtered by human move plausibility at target Elo (see Maia Chess approach)
- Offline API data caching — chess data is user-specific + authenticated; caching risks stale analysis
- Swipe-to-navigate between tabs — conflicts with chessboard touch gestures

## Current Milestone: v1.3 Project Launch

**Goal:** Rebrand to FlawChess, deploy to production on Hetzner, and ship everything needed for a public launch — Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, About page, SEO, analytics.

**Target features:**
- Rename project to FlawChess (code, repo, branding)
- Dockerized deployment on Hetzner Cloud with Caddy (auto-SSL)
- Deployment pipeline (CI/CD or scripted)
- Error/performance monitoring (Sentry or similar)
- About page with USPs, FAQ
- Professional README
- Google Analytics (or privacy-friendly alternative)
- SEO fundamentals
- Privacy policy & cookie consent
- Import queue for concurrent rate-limit safety

## Context

- **Current state:** v1.2 shipped. 19 phases complete across 3 milestones. ~11,800 Python LOC, ~5,500 TypeScript LOC (excluding node_modules).
- **Stack:** FastAPI + React 19/TS/Vite 5 + PostgreSQL + python-chess + TanStack Query + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Auth:** FastAPI-Users (JWT + Google SSO)
- **Core algorithm:** Zobrist hashes (white_hash, black_hash, full_hash) precomputed at import for indexed integer equality lookups
- **PWA:** vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox (NetworkOnly for API routes), vaul drawer, tailwindcss-safe-area
- **Known issues:** react-chessboard v5 arrow clearing workaround (clearArrowsOnPositionChange: false), BoardArrow local type definition, touch drag disabled (click-to-move only on mobile)

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Python backend (FastAPI), uv for package management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with asyncpg — must support efficient position-based queries across thousands of games
- **Deployment**: Must work locally and be deployable to a server
- **Libraries**: Use established open-source libraries (python-chess, etc.) rather than reinventing
- **HTTP client**: httpx async only — never use requests or berserk

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| FastAPI for backend | User expertise, async support, modern Python | ✓ Good |
| API-only import (no PGN upload) | Simpler v1, covers primary use case | ✓ Good |
| Interactive board over FEN input | Better UX for target users | ✓ Good |
| uv for package management | Fast, modern Python tooling | ✓ Good |
| React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 5 | react-chessboard 5.x requires React 19 | ✓ Good |
| PostgreSQL (no SQLite) | Multi-user concurrent writes, BIGINT index, asyncpg | ✓ Good |
| DB wipe for v1.1 | No migration needed — reimport after schema change | ✓ Good |
| Zobrist hash position matching | 64-bit integer equality vs FEN string comparison | ✓ Good |
| move_san ply semantics | SAN on ply N = move played FROM that position | ✓ Good |
| DISTINCT + GROUP BY for transpositions | COUNT(DISTINCT g.id) prevents double-counting | ✓ Good |
| Filter state in OpeningsPage parent | Survives tab switches without reset | ✓ Good |
| QueryClient singleton in lib/ | Shared across 401 interceptor and auth transitions | ✓ Good |
| vite-plugin-pwa with generateSW | Zero-config, Vite 7 compatible, Workbox managed | ✓ Good |
| vaul for mobile drawer | Handles scroll lock, backdrop, iOS momentum natively | ✓ Good |
| Click-to-move only on mobile | HTML5 DnD absent on iOS Safari; drag causes black screen | ✓ Good |
| Duplicate mobile Openings layout | Sticky board incompatible with sidebar's flex-column | ⚠️ Revisit |
