# Project State: FlawChess

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-04-04 — Milestone v1.8 started

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)
Core value: Users can determine their success rate for any opening position they specify
Current focus: v1.8 Advanced Analytics

## Key Context

- Stack: FastAPI + React/TS/Vite + PostgreSQL + python-chess
- ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.x async + Alembic
- Auth: FastAPI-Users 15.0.4 (JWT, integer user IDs)
- Core algorithm: Zobrist hashes (white_hash, black_hash, full_hash) precomputed at import
- Deployment: Docker Compose on Hetzner CX32 (2 vCPUs, 3.7 GB RAM + 2 GB swap)

## Accumulated Context

### Pending Todos

- **Human-like engine analysis** (general) — v2+ engine eval filtered by human move plausibility at target Elo
- **Bitboard storage for partial-position queries** (database) — 12 BIGINT bitboard columns on game_positions

### Blockers/Concerns

- Backfill batch_size MUST be 10 games (~400 rows) per commit — prior OOM at batch_size=50 (production incident)
- bulk_insert_positions chunk_size tuning required when adding columns — asyncpg 32767 arg limit
