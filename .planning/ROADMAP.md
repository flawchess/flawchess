## Phases

### Phase 90: Import Pipeline Memory Leak Fix + Resilience

**Goal:** Eliminate the per-batch unique-SQL leak in `_flush_batch` Stage 5 that OOM-killed prod twice (2026-03-22, 2026-05-16; FLAWCHESS-56 / FLAWCHESS-3Q), and ship the two leak-independent resilience defects carried forward from SEED-017 so a Postgres OOM no longer strands jobs `in_progress` indefinitely.

**Scope (in):**
1. **Primary leak fix** — replace the literal `case()`+`IN` bulk UPDATE in `_flush_batch` Stage 5 with bound-parameter `executemany`, preserving the `result_fen` None-handling (two executemany groups, or COALESCE/keep-existing) so games without a result_fen aren't silently NULLed.
2. **Defense-in-depth session-recycle** — scope `AsyncSession` per batch inside `run_import`'s loop (currently one session for the whole import at `import_service.py:281`); touches job-record creation, the previous-job/`since` lookup, and per-batch progress commits.
3. **Scheduled / on-reconnect orphan-job reaper** — `cleanup_orphaned_jobs()` currently runs only at backend startup; add a periodic task and/or on-DB-reconnect hook so a Postgres-only restart doesn't strand `in_progress` jobs.
4. **Resilient failure-state recording** — bounded retry with backoff around the `except Exception` UPDATE in `run_import` (~386–410) so a still-recovering DB doesn't swallow the `failed` transition.

**Scope (out):**
- Atomic duplicate-import guard (SEED-017 part 1, demoted to optional UX/data-hygiene in SEED-018) — not recurrence-preventing; single import OOMs alone.
- Automated regression test for the leak — verified manually instead (see Verification).

**Verification:** manual import of a real ~5k+ game account in dev, watching backend RSS stay flat across the full import (vs. linear climb today). Repeat in prod after deploy, then resolve Sentry FLAWCHESS-56 (120262007) and FLAWCHESS-3Q (115610288).

Plans:
- [x] All plans completed — see Phase 90 phase dir.

### Phase 91: Two-lane import — defer Stockfish eval to in-process cold drain

**Goal:** Restructure the import pipeline so the hot path (fetch → parse → insert positions → commit) holds no Stockfish work, and a separate in-process cold-drain coroutine evaluates entry plies in the background. Two concurrent 20k-game imports must complete without OOM-killing Postgres (the 2026-05-20 stress-test failure mode), the user must see opening-explorer / raw endgame WDL / flag-rate / time-per-move stats within seconds of import start, and Stockfish-dependent stats (conversion, recovery, score-gap, time-pressure-vs-performance) must fill in over the following minutes with honest per-metric sample-size labels.

**Scope (in):**
1. **Schema** — add `games.evals_completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` + partial index `WHERE evals_completed_at IS NULL`. Backfill existing rows to `COALESCE(updated_at, created_at, NOW())` so the cold lane doesn't re-eval the historical corpus.
2. **Hot-lane refactor** — strip Stages 3a (`_collect_midgame_eval_targets` / `_collect_endgame_span_eval_targets`), 4 (`asyncio.gather` over `engine.evaluate`), and the per-target UPDATE in `_apply_eval_results` out of `_flush_batch`. Add per-game evaluation of "are all entry plies already lichess-`%eval`-covered?" to set `evals_completed_at` in the same write.
3. **Cold-lane drain** — new `run_eval_drain()` coroutine wired in `app/main.py` lifespan alongside `run_periodic_reaper`. Picks 10 games per tick from `WHERE evals_completed_at IS NULL ORDER BY id LIMIT 10`, derives entry-ply targets, `asyncio.gather` outside any session scope, opens session only as a short write window for the combined UPDATE batch. Runs in parallel with active imports (no admission gate — lanes don't compete once eval is out of the hot tx). Idempotent on crash.
4. **Frontend header bar** — small `<Cpu /> X% Stockfish analysis complete (N games pending)` indicator driven by per-user `COUNT(*) WHERE evals_completed_at IS NULL`. Hidden when pending == 0. Polled every ~10s while >0.
5. **Per-metric pending caveat** — extend the existing `EvalConfidenceTooltip` / `MetricStatPopover` body on every Stockfish-dependent stat with a one-line "based on N of M eligible games, K still being evaluated" when pending > 0.
6. **Tests** — hot-lane RSS plateau under dual-import dev test, cold-lane idempotency on simulated crash mid-batch, schema migration up/down, partial index used by drain query (EXPLAIN check).

**Scope (out):**
- Concurrent-import admission control (SEED-022 option F) — optional, deferred. Hot-lane batches become too cheap to OOM under realistic concurrent load; revisit if production traffic surfaces a separate bottleneck.
- Scheduled backend restart cadence (SEED-022 option G) and idempotent `on_game_fetched` (SEED-022 option A′) — small, independent, can land any time as `/gsd-fast`.
- Profiling phase originally drafted under SEED-022 — **withdrawn**, this phase replaces it. Architecture rewrite addresses the root cause directly; profiling would document a workload that no longer exists.

**Verification:** dev-side re-run of the 2× 20k stress test pattern (lichess + chess.com concurrent on a freshly-cloned account) with `docker stats` + `pg_stat_activity` polling. Acceptance: backend RSS plateaus ≤ 1.6 GB, Postgres anon+shmem ≤ 1.2 GB sustained, swap never exceeds 50 % of allocated swap, both imports complete `status=completed`, eval coverage bar reaches 100 % within N minutes after the second import finishes. Production re-run after deploy on a real ≥10k-game account.

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Password Reset (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Users can recover account access when they forget their password — request reset link, receive email, set new password
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 5/6 plans executed

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.5: Hybrid Stockfish Eval for Conversion/Recovery (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Use Stockfish eval (`eval_cp`) as the advantage/disadvantage signal for conversion/recovery classification when available, falling back to material imbalance + 4-ply persistence for games without eval. Stockfish eval is the gold standard (no persistence filter needed since eval handles transient trades natively). Currently only ~15% of Lichess games have eval data and chess.com has 0%, but this improves automatically as more games get server-analyzed. Validated in `docs/endgame-conversion-recovery-analysis.md`: persistence closes 50-70% of the gap to Stockfish for pawn/mixed endgames, but a hybrid approach would eliminate the remaining 5-8pp offset for eval-available games.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.4: Position-Based Most Played Openings via game_positions (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Redesign "Most Played Openings" to count how many games *passed through* each opening position (via `game_positions` Zobrist hash matching) instead of counting final opening name classifications from chess.com/lichess. Currently "1. e4" shows ~75 games (only games *classified* as "King's Pawn Game") while obscure specific lines rank higher. Position-based counting would show all ~2000+ games that played 1. e4, consistent with FlawChess's core Zobrist hash architecture. Requires JOIN from `openings` reference table to `game_positions` on FEN or precomputed hash, then `COUNT(DISTINCT game_id)`.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.6: Opening Risk & Drawishness (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Risk and drawishness metrics per position in the move explorer.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans
**Context:** Moved from v1.10 Advanced Analytics — v1.10 is an endgame-focused milestone and opening risk metrics are a better fit for the upcoming Opening Insights milestone (discovering weaknesses in most-played opening lines). Re-evaluate scope at that time.

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd-review-backlog when ready)
