/**
 * calibration-determinism.check.mjs — D-09 seeded-reproducibility assertion
 * (Phase 168, Plan 02, Task 2; re-budgeted Phase 168.5, Plan 05, Task 3, SC5).
 *
 * Runs `playGame()` from `../calibration-harness.mjs` TWICE against REAL
 * engines (Maia ONNX + Stockfish WASM — unlike the stub-provider
 * `calibration-parity.check.mjs`, this is a real-engine check) with the
 * IDENTICAL seed/opening/color, for a full `blend=1` game, and asserts
 * (`node:assert/strict`) the two resulting `moveUcis` sequences are
 * byte-identical.
 *
 * The anchor is a raw-Maia-argmax anchor (`maia1500`), deliberately NOT a
 * Stockfish-skill anchor — Stockfish's own `Skill Level` weakening injects
 * engine-internal randomness that would confound this test with a source of
 * nondeterminism unrelated to the harness's OWN seeded `mulberry32` rng
 * (D-09's actual subject: `selectBotMove`'s deterministic `blend=1` argmax
 * regime + the seeded rng plumbing, not Stockfish's skill-level noise).
 *
 * **Phase 168.5-05 SC5 re-budget:** this check now runs `playGame` at its
 * DEFAULT budget — i.e. no `maxNodes`/`maxPlies` override — which resolves to
 * the actual SHIPPED bot budget (`FLAWCHESS_BOT_MAX_NODES`=50/
 * `FLAWCHESS_BOT_MAX_PLIES`=8), and `playGame` has ALWAYS unconditionally
 * carried `stopRule: FLAWCHESS_BOT_STOP_RULE` + the pinned
 * `FLAWCHESS_BOT_CONCURRENCY` since 168.5-04 Task 2 (there is no override
 * knob for those two — they are not parameters `playGame` accepts). The old
 * `DETERMINISM_MAX_NODES=20` override (a Plan 02 artifact, back when the D-11
 * budget was still 400 nodes and a full-cost run took ~170s/move) is REMOVED
 * — Plan 04's real-engine measurement (`168.5-04-SUMMARY.md`) found the
 * SHIPPED 50-node/stop-rule-gated budget already costs only ~5.4s median/
 * ~12.7s worst-case per move, so there is no longer a reason to run this
 * proof at an artificially reduced budget: SC5 requires proving determinism
 * of the bot that ships, and the real budget is now cheap enough to just use
 * directly (see the imported `FLAWCHESS_BOT_*` constants below).
 *
 * Plan 03 note (investigated during Task 1): under real machine load, a
 * `grade()` call can exceed its `GRADING_MOVETIME_SAFETY_CAP_MS + SLACK_MS`
 * (5000ms) response-wait ceiling, which THROWS (not silently degrades) and
 * aborts the whole check with a "Stockfish response timeout" error — this is
 * a PRE-EXISTING fragility of the movetime-capped grading design inherited
 * from Plan 01/02, confirmed via an A/B test that reproduced the IDENTICAL
 * timeout on the untouched pre-pool (Plan 02) code on the same loaded
 * machine — NOT a regression introduced by the Stockfish pool. It surfaces
 * as either a hard timeout (as above) or, more subtly, a byte-level replay
 * divergence: if a `movetime`-bounded search doesn't reach
 * `GRADING_TARGET_DEPTH` identically in both runs (because real elapsed time
 * relative to the 2500ms cap differs run-to-run under load), the returned
 * eval can differ by a few centipawns, which `mctsSearch`'s own
 * deterministic-per-concurrency-level node-selection (mctsSearch.ts's module
 * header) then legitimately propagates into a different move choice — this
 * applies at ANY pool size, including 1, since it is a property of the
 * ENGINE's real-time response, not of routing across independent pool
 * engines. Phase 168.5-02 (D-10) fixed this at the root (depth-only `go` +
 * `Clear Hash` per grading/adjudication call, load-independent by
 * construction) — this note is kept as history; a recurrence here would be a
 * regression, not an expected flake.
 *
 * Phase 184 (CAL-04) extension: `playGame` gained an optional `style` param
 * (`BotStyleParams`, forwarded into `selectBotMove`'s `BotSettings.style`
 * ONLY when defined — a conditional spread, never a literal `style:
 * undefined` key). Two additional assertions below cover the new seam:
 *
 *   1. STYLE-05 absent-style byte-identity (real engines): a `playGame` run
 *      that OMITS `style` entirely must be byte-identical to one that passes
 *      `style: undefined` explicitly, under the same seed — proving the
 *      conditional spread genuinely leaves `BotSettings` structurally
 *      unchanged, not just "usually produces the same move".
 *   2. A DEFINED style bundle reaches `selectBotMove` and changes its
 *      output. This assertion calls the REAL `selectBotMove` directly with
 *      DETERMINISTIC STUB `policy`/`grade` providers and a fixed `rng`
 *      (mirrors `calibration-parity.check.mjs`'s stub-provider convention)
 *      rather than playing a second/third full real-engine game — a fixed
 *      `rng` and hand-derived cumulative weights make the flip
 *      deterministic and fast, instead of relying on a real Maia policy
 *      distribution to probabilistically diverge over a multi-ply game.
 *
 * Run via: node --import ./scripts/lib/frontend-alias-hook.mjs scripts/lib/calibration-determinism.check.mjs
