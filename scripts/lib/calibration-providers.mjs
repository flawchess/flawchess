/**
 * calibration-providers.mjs — the Node `EngineProviders` adapter (Phase 168,
 * CAL-02) satisfying `frontend/src/lib/engine/types.ts`'s frozen contract:
 * `policy(fen, elo, side)` UCI-keyed, `grade(fen, candidateUcis)`
 * UCI-keyed/searchmoves-restricted/depth-carrying.
 *
 * `nodeGrade` mirrors `frontend/src/lib/engine/workerPool.ts`'s
 * `sendGo`/`handleLine` (UCI-keyed by `parsed.pv[0]`, `bound === 'exact'`
 * only, `depth` carried) — this is deliberately NOT
 * `gem-elo-calibration.mjs`'s `gradePosition` (SAN-keyed, all-legal-move
 * MultiPV, no `depth` field — wrong contract for `mctsSearch`, 168-RESEARCH.md
 * Pitfall 1).
 *
 * `nodePolicy` adapts `gem-elo-calibration.mjs`'s `maiaProbsForPosition`
 * (multi-rung batched) down to a single-rung, single-call shape, then
 * converts each `maskAndSoftmax` SAN key to UCI via `sanToUci` — mirrors
 * `frontend/src/lib/engine/maiaQueue.ts`'s SAN->UCI conversion step.
 *
 * STALE CLAIM, CORRECTED (198-DISPATCH-02, 2026-07-31): this paragraph used
 * to assert "the harness fixes `SearchBudget.concurrency = 1` ... so only ONE
 * `policy()`/`grade()` call is ever in flight at a time — no async queue is
 * needed here". That has been false since Phase 168.5:
 * `scripts/calibration-harness.mjs:593` pins `concurrency: FLAWCHESS_BOT_CONCURRENCY`
 * (currently 4) against a `STOCKFISH_POOL_DEFAULT_SIZE`-sized Stockfish pool,
 * so up to `FLAWCHESS_BOT_CONCURRENCY` `policy()`/`grade()` calls CAN be
 * concurrently in flight from `mctsSearch`'s dispatch loop. The app, by
 * contrast, serialises Maia strictly to one inference in flight through
 * `maiaWorkerHost`'s lease (`maiaQueue.ts`'s `dispatching` gate) — this module
 * does NOT mirror that by default. `maiaInflightStats` below is the committed
 * instrument that replaces this paragraph's old assertion with a measurement,
 * and `makeNodeProviders`'s opt-in `{ maiaFifo: true }` option (Phase 198,
 * D-03) is what actually reproduces the app's single-in-flight discipline
 * when a measurement pass needs to be app-faithful.
 *
 * Pitfall 2 (168-RESEARCH.md): a shared Stockfish process (or, since Plan 03,
 * ANY process drawn from the `stockfish-pool.mjs` pool) also serves the
 * anchor move-choosers (`calibration-anchors.mjs`) and adjudication.
 * `nodeGrade` resets the engine to full strength on EVERY call so a prior
 * weakened anchor `Skill Level` never leaks into the bot's own grading.
 *
 * `nodeGrade` and `evalPositionCp` both take the engine as their FIRST
 * argument (not a closed-over shared instance) so `stockfish-pool.mjs` can
 * route each call through a freshly-ACQUIRED pool engine (Plan 03, Task 1) —
 * `makeNodeProviders` closes over `pool.grade` directly, not a single engine.
 *
 * `runMaia` is the shared private helper `nodePolicy` reads from, memoized
 * per (fen, elo) so repeat calls for the same position never re-run the
 * model. This mirrors the app's own co-located `maiaPolicyCache.ts` cache
 * shape one level down, at the raw-inference layer rather than the
 * softmaxed-result layer, because the harness (unlike the app) has no
 * persistent cross-search cache to co-locate into.
