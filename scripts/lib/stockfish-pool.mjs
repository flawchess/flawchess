/**
 * stockfish-pool.mjs — N-process Stockfish pool (Phase 168, Plan 03, Task 1),
 * mirroring `frontend/src/lib/engine/workerPool.ts`'s free-slot queue over
 * `node:child_process` instances instead of Web Workers.
 *
 * The CAL-03 spike (168-02-SUMMARY.md) found the bottleneck is `grade()`
 * serialization inside `mctsSearch` under a SINGLE shared Stockfish process
 * (`SEARCH_CONCURRENCY=1`), NOT Maia/ONNX inference (168-RESEARCH.md
 * Pitfall 3). The fix is N independently-spawned Stockfish processes so
 * `mctsSearch` can dispatch up to `size` concurrent `grade()` calls — each
 * individual process STILL serves only one `go` at a time (never overlapping
 * `go`s on the SAME process); throughput comes from parallelizing ACROSS
 * processes, not from multiplexing one.
 *
 * Every request (bot grading, Stockfish-skill anchor moves, adjudication
 * evals) reuses the existing per-engine UCI logic
 * (`calibration-providers.mjs`'s `nodeGrade`/`evalPositionCp`,
 * `calibration-anchors.mjs`'s `stockfishSkillMove`) — each of which already
 * resets every option it depends on (Skill Level/UCI_LimitStrength/MultiPV)
 * immediately before its own `go` (Pitfall 2). Routing those same functions
 * through this pool's acquire/release preserves that per-call reset
 * discipline PER PROCESS: a weakened Skill Level set on one engine for an
 * anchor move can never leak into a different engine's bot-grading `go`.
 *
 * D-11 (168.5-02, Task 2): `withEngine` also retries a timed-out `go` in
 * place up to `ENGINE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` times via `runWithRetry`, reusing
 * `stopAndSync()` between attempts, so a single slow reply degrades to a
 * retry rather than aborting the whole multi-hour sweep.
