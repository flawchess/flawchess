"""Backfill engine best_move + pv at flaw plies for stored games (SEED-054).

Why this script exists
----------------------
The Flaw card / Library Game card render a blue "better alternative" arrow from
`game_positions[flaw_ply].best_move` — the engine's best move FROM the pre-blunder
decision board. The live drain (pre-SEED-054) only ever engine-evaluated
`flaw_ply + 1` (the opponent's reply), which left two holes in already-stored games:

- **lichess-eval games** (`lichess_evals_at IS NOT NULL`): `best_move` AND `pv` are
  NULL at `flaw_ply` (lichess supplies %eval but no best_move/no PV) — the arrow
  silently doesn't render.
- **engine-analyzed games** (chess.com etc., `lichess_evals_at IS NULL`): `best_move`
  is already set at every ply (the engine ran on all of them), but `pv` is NULL at
  `flaw_ply` — only `flaw_ply + 1`'s refutation pv was written (D-117-02). The arrow
  works there; the missing piece is the ideal-continuation `pv[flaw_ply]`.

SEED-054 fixes the drain to also evaluate `flaw_ply` going forward; this script
backfills BOTH holes for games already stored. It runs from a local machine targeting
prod over the SSH tunnel and writes the columns IN PLACE — it never touches the
completion markers (`full_evals_completed_at` / `full_pv_completed_at`), so games
never drop out of the Library / stats analyzed-gate mid-run (the decisive reason for a
dedicated script over a worker re-enqueue — see SEED-054).

Scope is "already-analyzed games" by construction: it only touches positions that have
`game_flaws` rows, which exist only after a full drain tick. So the engine compute was
already spent; this run merely completes the best_move/pv columns on those games. No
guest-account filter — a guest who ran on-demand "Analyze" on a lichess game hit the
same broken arrow, so they should get the fix too.

What it writes
--------------
For each game position at a flaw ply or flaw+1, the engine runs a 1M-node search and
the script writes, per row, ONLY the column(s) that were actually NULL:
- best_move (the better alternative / refutation move) — when it was NULL and the
  engine returns one.
- pv (the principal-variation line) — when it was NULL and the engine returns one.
- NEVER eval_cp / eval_mate: a lichess %eval or a prior engine eval at this ply is
  authoritative and preserved (same is_lichess_eval_game discipline as
  eval_drain._apply_full_eval_results). Writing only the originally-NULL column means
  an engine game's existing best_move is never clobbered by a (non-deterministic) fresh
  search — only its missing pv is filled.

The write keying is identical to the live drain by construction: this script reuses
`eval_drain._batch_update_best_move_rows` and `eval_drain._batch_update_pv_rows`.

Idempotent / resumable
----------------------
Selection is gated on `best_move IS NULL OR pv IS NULL`, so a dropped SSH tunnel or
Ctrl-C → just re-run; filled positions drop out of the predicate. This subsumes the
SEED-043 cohort (never-reprocessed lichess games, NULL at both flaw plies), the
SEED-054 lichess keying gap (best_move NULL at flaw_ply), AND the engine-game pv gap
(best_move set, pv NULL at flaw_ply) in one pass.

DB target host:port mapping (CLAUDE.md):
    dev:       localhost:5432  (Docker compose flawchess-dev)
    benchmark: localhost:5433  (Docker compose flawchess-benchmark)
    prod:      localhost:15432 (via bin/prod_db_tunnel.sh)

Stockfish binary: auto-discovered by app.services.engine (STOCKFISH_PATH, else
/usr/local/bin/stockfish, else ~/.local/stockfish/sf, else `stockfish` on PATH).

Usage:
    # Size it first (tunnel up):
    uv run python scripts/backfill_best_move_pv.py --db prod --dry-run

    # Smoke on dev:
    uv run python scripts/backfill_best_move_pv.py --db dev --limit 50 --workers 4

    # Scope to a single user (--user-id) — handy to size/verify one account before
    # the full prod pass (e.g. user 13):
    uv run python scripts/backfill_best_move_pv.py --db prod --user-id 13 --dry-run
    uv run python scripts/backfill_best_move_pv.py --db prod --user-id 13 --workers 10

    # Full prod backfill from the local machine (zero prod compute):
    bin/prod_db_tunnel.sh
    uv run python scripts/backfill_best_move_pv.py --db prod --workers 10

Parallelism (--workers, default 1):
    Runs N independent Stockfish processes (Threads=1 each) via EnginePool. On a
    16 vCPU workstation, 10-12 is a good upper bound (leave headroom for the SSH
    tunnel + OS). The engine runs on the LOCAL machine → zero prod compute impact,
    so there is no prod 4g-container constraint to respect here. Do NOT run this
    script ON the prod server with a high --workers.
