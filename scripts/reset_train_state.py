"""Reset one user's Train state so a schedule test can start from a clean slate.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    ``app/core/dev_clock.py`` lets local dev shift the clock the Train
    endpoints compute against, so the calendar-shaped behaviour (weekday mask,
    session expiry, the spaced-repetition due-date ladder, Mon-start streak
    weeks) can be exercised in one sitting instead of over real days. The
    catch: rows written while the clock is shifted persist with the SHIFTED
    dates. Travel a month forward, solve a few sessions, then reset the
    offset, and the user is left with drill items due in the future and a
    streak snapshot settled past today. This wipes that back to zero.

WHAT IT DELETES / RESETS (for ONE user)
    - ``drill_solves``  — deleted (cascades from drill_sessions anyway; deleted
      explicitly so the counts printed are honest).
    - ``drill_sessions`` — deleted.
    - ``drill_items``   — deleted. The pool is re-materialised from the user's
      own qualifying blunders on the next ``POST /train/sessions``, so this
      loses only spaced-repetition progress, never game/flaw data.
    - ``train_settings`` — the per-day tick snapshot columns
      (``streak_count``, ``shield_level``, ``streak_settled_through``,
      ``pool_eligible_since``) reset to 0/0/NULL/NULL. The watermark is
      derived state, not a user setting, so a clean slate must clear it too
      — leaving a stale ``pool_eligible_since`` behind would let a
      time-travelled run silently treat "the OLD material-discovery date" as
      still valid after the drill_items that earned it were just deleted.
      Phase 222 (TRAINBOT-05, D-13): the three bot-onboarding "seen"
      watermarks (``intro_seen_at``, ``reveal_walkthrough_seen_at``,
      ``sr_explained_at``) are ALSO reset to NULL here, so every stepper
      replays on the next session — without this, each one shows exactly
      once per account, ever.
      ``timezone``/``weekday_mask``/``puzzles_per_session`` are DELIBERATELY
      kept: they are the schedule under test, and re-picking them in the UI
      after every reset would be pure friction. Pass ``--reset-settings`` to
      drop the row entirely and get the D-06/D-07/D-08 defaults back on next
      touch.

    Nothing outside these four tables is touched — no games, positions, flaws,
    or evals.

DB target (per CLAUDE.md), selected with ``--db``:
    dev:       localhost:5432  (flawchess-dev Docker compose) — the usual target
    benchmark: localhost:5433
    prod:      localhost:15432 via ``bin/prod_db_tunnel.sh``. Allowed, but ONLY
               ever for a single explicitly named ``--user-id`` (the script has
               no "all users" mode and refuses a non-positive id), and only
               after an explicit confirmation: interactively you must type the
               user id back, non-interactively you must pass ``--yes``. This is
               destructive, unrecoverable state — a support/debug reset of one
               account, never a bulk operation.

Usage:
    # Show what would be deleted, touch nothing:
    uv run python scripts/reset_train_state.py --user-id 1 --dry-run

    # Reset Train progress, keep the schedule settings:
    uv run python scripts/reset_train_state.py --user-id 1

    # Also drop the settings row (back to first-touch defaults):
    uv run python scripts/reset_train_state.py --user-id 1 --reset-settings

    # One user on production (tunnel must be running):
    bin/prod_db_tunnel.sh
    uv run python scripts/reset_train_state.py --db prod --user-id 28 --dry-run
    uv run python scripts/reset_train_state.py --db prod --user-id 28 --yes
