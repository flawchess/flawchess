"""Shared SQL building blocks + pure bucketing helpers for the benchmark generator.

These mirror the canonical fragments in `.claude/skills/benchmarks/SKILL.md`
("Cell anchoring", "Standard CTE — `selected_users`", "Equal-footing opponent
filter", "Sparse-cell exclusion"). Every chapter imports from here so the cohort
definition, ELO bucketing, and equal-footing filter cannot drift between queries.

FAITHFUL PORT (SEED-029 #1): the SQL strings reproduce the skill's blocks verbatim.
The one deliberate simplification vs SKILL.md is dropping the "current-DB-state
checkpoint exception" (the `lower()` join with no checkpoint filter): the benchmark
DB now has completed checkpoints for all five ELO buckets, so the canonical
checkpoint-join CTE is the only path and reproduces `benchmarks-latest.md` exactly.
