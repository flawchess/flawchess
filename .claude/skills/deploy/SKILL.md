description: Deploy FlawChess to production end-to-end without interruption — open a PR from main to production, squash-merge it immediately (CI does not run on PRs), run bin/deploy.sh (which runs the full CI matrix on the production branch), fix anything CI complains about (Dependabot CVEs, ruff/ty drift, merge conflicts, branch divergence, frontend lint), and monitor it through to a verified server SHA on flawchess.com. Use this skill whenever the user asks to deploy, ship, release, push to prod, promote main to production, cut a release, or run bin/deploy.sh. Trigger on phrases like "deploy", "deploy to prod", "ship it", "release", "promote main", "push to production", "cut a release", "go live", or any request to get current main running on flawchess.com. This is a SET-AND-FORGET flow: stream status as milestones complete, but do not pause for user approval at any stage — only halt when a situation is genuinely ambiguous (dirty working tree that might be in-progress work, repeated unrecoverable CI failure after multiple fix attempts, server SHA mismatch after deploy) or destructive (force-push, branch deletion, manual SSH deploy).

# Deploy to Production

End-to-end production deploy for FlawChess. Runs the full `main → production` release flow autonomously, including fixing whatever CI complains about along the way. Stream status updates so the user can see what's happening, but don't pause for approval unless something is genuinely ambiguous (see *When to halt*).

## When to use

- The user explicitly asks to deploy, ship, release, or push to production.
- A milestone closes and they want it live.
- A hotfix on `main` (or a fast-follow fix) needs to reach prod.

If the user is asking about deploy *mechanics* (how it works, what the script does) without asking to actually run it, don't trigger — answer the question instead.

## Mental model

FlawChess uses GitLab Flow:
- `main` = integration trunk
- `production` = exactly what's deployed
- A deploy = `main → production` PR, squash-merged, then `bin/deploy.sh` (which deploys the `production` branch via GitHub Actions).

The full pipeline is: **preflight → open PR → squash-merge (no PR checks — CI does not run on PRs) → announce → bin/deploy.sh (this is where CI runs, on `production`) → monitor → verify**.

This is **set-and-forget**: run the whole pipeline end-to-end without asking for approval at intermediate steps. CI babysitting, Dependabot bumps, formatter fixes, ty errors, merge conflicts, branch divergence — handle autonomously, stream a one-line status update at each milestone, and keep moving. Stop only for situations described under *When to halt* below. Never wait for a "go ahead" between merge and deploy — that defeats the purpose of the skill.

## Step 1: Preflight

Run these in parallel and report any blockers before doing anything else:

```bash
git status --porcelain                        # working tree must be clean
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD               # should be main
git fetch origin main production --quiet      # sync refs
git log --oneline origin/production..origin/main  # what's about to ship
ls -la .prod.env                              # required by bin/deploy.sh (scp'd to server)
```

Blockers and how to resolve:

- **Dirty working tree** — stop and ask the user. Don't stash or commit on their behalf (might destroy in-progress work).
- **Not on `main`** — switch (`git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`) only if the working tree is clean; otherwise stop.
- **`main` behind `origin/main`** — `git pull --ff-only origin main` (resolve autonomously).
- **`main` and `origin/main` diverged** (non-fast-forward) — see `references/ci-fixes.md` § *Git: divergence and merge conflicts*. Resolve autonomously when the fix is mechanical (rebase clean, conflict only in lockfiles or CHANGELOG); stop and report otherwise.
- **Nothing to deploy** (`origin/production..origin/main` is empty) — tell the user, stop. Don't open an empty PR.
- **`.prod.env` missing locally** — stop and tell the user to fetch it (`bin/download_1password.sh`). The deploy script `scp`s it to the server; without it, the deploy will fail with a confusing error mid-pipeline.

Then run the pre-PR gates locally so CI doesn't have to bounce them back:

```bash
uv run ruff format app/ tests/
uv run ruff check app/ tests/ --fix
uv run ty check app/ tests/
( cd frontend && npm run lint )
```

If any of these modify files, commit with a `chore(release):` or `style(release):` prefix and push to `main` before opening the release PR. Skip the test suites here — CI runs them and that's faster than running locally for a release-prep step.

## Step 2: Open the release PR

Compose the PR body from the squashed commit log between `production` and `main`. Group by Conventional Commit type when possible (feat / fix / refactor / chore / docs). Keep it skimmable — this becomes the squash-merge commit message and lands in `git log` on the `production` branch.

```bash
gh pr create --base production --head main \
  --title "Release: <one-line summary of biggest change(s)>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's shipping

<grouped bullet list from git log production..main, terse and user-facing>

## Phases / PRs included

<list of phase numbers or PR refs if identifiable from commit messages>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

Capture the PR number — you'll need it for the merge step.

## Step 3: No CI on PRs — merge directly

**CI does NOT run on pull requests in this repo.** There are no PR checks on the release PR; `gh pr checks <PR#>` reports "no checks reported" and `--watch` would wait forever. Do not wait for, poll, or try to trigger PR checks.

The full CI matrix runs later, when `bin/deploy.sh` dispatches the workflow on the `production` branch (Step 6). That run is the real gate — a red run there blocks the deploy. The local gates from Step 1 are what keep that run green.

If CI fails during Step 6, fix on `main` and restart the flow from Step 2 (new release PR with the fix included), or see `references/ci-fixes.md` for the common failure modes (Dependabot vulnerabilities, ruff/ty drift, frontend test flakes, etc.).

If you've tried 2-3 distinct fixes for the same failure and it's still red, stop and report what you've tried. Don't churn indefinitely.

## Step 4: Squash-merge

Immediately after opening the PR (no checks to wait for):

```bash
gh pr merge <PR#> --squash --delete-branch=false
```

`--delete-branch=false` is critical: deleting `main` would be catastrophic. The squash merge writes one commit onto `production` with the PR title + body as the message.

After merging, sync local refs so the next `bin/deploy.sh` sees the right commit:

```bash
git fetch origin production
```

## Step 5: Announce the deploy (do not wait)

Print a one-block status message so the user knows the deploy is starting, then proceed directly to step 6 in the same turn. **Do not ask "should I deploy?" — the user invoked this skill to deploy.** They can interrupt if they need to.

The announcement should be terse, just enough to let the user scan and intervene if something is wrong:

```
✅ Merged PR #<N>  (<merge-sha>  →  origin/production)
   <one-line summary of what's shipping>
   <K> phases / <M> commits since last release
   Caveats: <any non-obvious CI fixes applied, e.g. "bumped axios 1.7.2→1.7.9 for CVE-2025-XXXX">

→ Running bin/deploy.sh now...
```

Then immediately run `bin/deploy.sh`. No question, no pause.

## Step 6: Deploy

```bash
bin/deploy.sh
```

This script already does the right things: it dispatches the CI workflow on `production`, asserts the dispatched run is on `production@TARGET_SHA`, watches the run via `gh run watch --exit-status`, then SSHes to the server to verify `HEAD` matches. It self-monitors. **Don't background it** — let its output stream so the user can see progress.

If `bin/deploy.sh` exits non-zero:

- **`scp .prod.env` failed** — usually network or SSH. Retry once. If it fails again, stop and report.
- **`no workflow_dispatch run found`** — race condition (rare). Re-run `bin/deploy.sh`.
- **Dispatched run is on wrong branch / SHA** — abort and investigate. Do NOT bypass the assertion.
- **CI failure during deploy** — check `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`. If it's a transient flake, `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` then re-run `bin/deploy.sh`. If it's a real failure, halt and report — fixing this is one of the few situations that needs the user to decide between forward-fix-via-main and hotfix-to-production.
- **Server SHA mismatch at the end** — server didn't converge. Check `ssh flawchess "cd /opt/flawchess && docker compose ps"` and the deploy logs. Don't claim success.

## Step 7: Post-deploy verification

After `bin/deploy.sh` exits 0, do a quick liveness check and report:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code} in %{time_total}s\n" https://flawchess.com/
ssh flawchess "cd /opt/flawchess && docker compose ps --format 'table {{.Service}}\t{{.Status}}'"
ssh flawchess "cd /opt/flawchess && docker compose logs --tail=20 backend"
```

Report: deploy succeeded, server is on `<sha>`, backend container is up, site responded 200. If the backend tail shows errors, surface them — the deploy script doesn't catch logical failures, only that containers came up.

## When to halt (and when NOT to)

This skill is set-and-forget. The default is: keep going, stream status, recover from anything mechanical. Halt only for these specific situations, and when you halt, surface the exact state and what you tried so the user can take over without re-investigating:

**Halt — genuinely ambiguous:**
- Dirty working tree at preflight (could be in-progress work — don't stash, don't commit on the user's behalf).
- `main` and `origin/main` diverged with conflicts outside lockfiles / CHANGELOG / generated files (anything in `app/` or `frontend/src/` that requires semantic judgment).
- `origin/production..origin/main` is empty (nothing to deploy — don't open an empty PR).
- `.prod.env` missing locally (deploy script will fail mid-pipeline with a confusing error).
- Same CI check has failed 3 times after distinct fix attempts — you're churning, escalate.
- `bin/deploy.sh` reports server SHA mismatch at the end — deploy did not converge, do NOT claim success.
- Deploy script aborts with "dispatched run is on wrong branch / SHA" — this is the 2026-05-16 incident's safety net firing; investigate, don't bypass.

**Do NOT halt — handle autonomously:**
- CI red because of Dependabot CVE — bump the dep (see `references/ci-fixes.md`).
- CI red because of ruff format drift — run formatter, commit, push.
- CI red because of ty error in code you just touched — fix and push.
- Branch behind `origin/main` — `git pull --ff-only`.
- Branch diverged but conflict is only in `package-lock.json` / `uv.lock` / `CHANGELOG.md` / generated files — resolve mechanically (see `references/ci-fixes.md`).
- Frontend test that's a known flake — retry once via `gh run rerun --failed`.
- Pre-push hook reformatting files — accept the reformat, commit, push again.
- `bin/deploy.sh` `scp` fails on a network blip — retry once.

When in doubt: prefer continuing with a noted caveat over halting. Halting wastes the "set and forget" property the user explicitly asked for.

## Hard rules (never break, even in auto-mode)

- **Never bypass `bin/deploy.sh`'s safety assertions** (branch check, SHA check, server SHA verify). They exist because of a 2026-05-16 incident where a deploy silently shipped unreleased `main` to prod.
- **Never deploy via direct SSH.** Saved in user memory as a hard rule. `bin/deploy.sh` is the only sanctioned path — it runs CI tests first.
- **Never force-push `main` or `production`.** Forward-fix instead. If a rebase would require force-push, halt and ask.
- **Never `git push --no-verify`** unless the pre-push hook itself is broken (then fix the hook, don't skip it). The hook catches the most common preventable CI failure on this project.
- **Never delete the `main` or `production` branch.** `gh pr merge` defaults to deleting the head branch — always pass `--delete-branch=false`.
- **Never edit `production` directly** outside of an approved hotfix flow. Releases go `main → PR → squash-merge to production`.
- **Hotfix path is separate.** If the user says "hotfix", route to the `hotfix/*` flow in `CLAUDE.md` (branch off `production`, PR into `production`, deploy, then forward-port to `main`). This skill is for the normal `main → production` release path.
