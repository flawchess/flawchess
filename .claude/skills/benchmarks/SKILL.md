description: Generate FlawChess endgame population benchmarks from the benchmark DB. Computes per-user distributions for score-gap (endgame vs non-endgame), Conversion/Parity/Recovery rates, composite Endgame Skill, time-pressure stats at endgame entry, time-pressure-vs-performance curves, and per-endgame-class (rook/minor_piece/pawn/queen/mixed/pawnless) score and conv/recov rates. All metrics are bucketed via 400-wide ELO buckets (anchored at 800/1200/1600/2000/2400) computed from the cohort user's **rating at game time** (`games.white_rating`/`games.black_rating`, never the frozen selection-snapshot rating — see "Rating-lag selection bias" in chapter 1) and the 4 TC buckets (anchored from `benchmark_selected_users.tc_bucket`). For every metric, the skill produces a Cohen's-d-based collapse verdict per axis ({TC, ELO}) that determines whether the metric needs cell-specific zones or collapses to a single global zone. Use this skill whenever the user asks about endgame benchmarks, neutral zones, gauge ranges, "what's typical", baseline distributions, calibrating thresholds, comparing time controls, deciding whether to collapse zones across TC or ELO, or breaking down stats by endgame class. Trigger on phrases like "benchmark", "benchmarks", "baseline", "neutral zone", "gauge range", "collapse verdict", "Cohen's d", "calibrate thresholds", "endgame type breakdown", "by endgame class", "rook vs minor piece". Writes the latest markdown report to reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md, rotating any prior latest file to reports/benchmark/benchmarks-YYYY-MM-DD.md based on its first-line date.

# Benchmarks

> **Phase 94.2 callout:** This SKILL describes the per-cohort analytical methodology used for `/benchmarks` reports — distribution exploration, neutral-zone calibration, "what's typical" breakdowns by (TC × ELO) bucket. The **production percentile chip uses a different methodology** since Phase 94.2: a pooled-per-user model (recent 1000/TC across all played TCs, 36-month window, single ≥30 floor on the pooled set, single globally pooled CDF). See `app/services/canonical_slice_sql.py` for the chip's SQL builders, `app/services/global_percentile_cdf.py` for the committed CDF literal, and `.planning/phases/94.2-pooled-per-user-percentile-redesign/94.2-CONTEXT.md` for the design rationale. The per-cohort stratification described below remains correct for analytical purposes — it just no longer mirrors what the production chip computes.

Generate population-level benchmarks for FlawChess from the benchmark DB. The headline deliverable is a **per-metric collapse verdict** answering: does this metric need cell-specific zones across (TC × ELO), or can it use a single global zone?

The skill is organized into three chapters that mirror the FlawChess UI: **Chapter 1 — Stratified Sample** holds the cell-coverage methodology that every metric depends on; **Chapter 2 — Openings** holds calibrations that feed the Openings page; **Chapter 3 — Endgames** holds calibrations that feed the Endgames → Stats page, with subchapters in the same display order as the page's H2 sections (Overall Performance → Metrics and ELO → Time Pressure → Type Breakdown).

## 1. Stratified Sample

### Methodology — how the benchmark sample was built

The benchmark DB is a two-stage stratified sample of Lichess players, designed so every (ELO bucket × TC bucket) cell is independently representative. Source-of-truth scripts: `scripts/select_benchmark_users.py` (selection) and `scripts/import_benchmark_users.py` (ingest). Both scripts persist their state to the benchmark DB, so the pipeline is resumable and the final dataset is fully reconstructible from the two tables `benchmark_selected_users` (candidate pool) and `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints` (per-(user, TC) ingest outcome).

#### Stage 1 — selection from a Lichess monthly PGN dump

`select_benchmark_users.py` produces a stratified **candidate pool**, not the final dataset. The pool is intentionally larger than the per-cell target (default `--per-cell 500`) so Stage 2 can keep pulling replacements when individual candidates fail or yield too few games.

1. **Input** — one Lichess monthly dump (`lichess_db_standard_rated_YYYY-MM.pgn.zst`). For the current DB this is `2026-03` (one `dump_month` value across all rows).
2. **Header-only PGN scan** — the dump is decompressed and streamed line-by-line without python-chess game-tree parsing. For each game, the script extracts only the seven PGN headers it needs (`White`, `Black`, `WhiteElo`, `BlackElo`, `TimeControl`, `Variant`) plus a substring check for `[%eval` on the moves line to mark the game as "analyzed by Lichess's server-side Stockfish". Game-tree parsing would 10×+ the runtime and is not needed at this stage.
3. **Variant filter** — Standard only. Chess960, crazyhouse, atomic, etc. are dropped.
4. **TC bucketing** — `estimated_seconds = base + 40 × increment` (canonical FlawChess rule). `< 180s = bullet`, `< 600s = blitz`, `≤ 1800s = rapid`, else `classical`. Correspondence games (`TimeControl = "-"`) are dropped entirely — Lichess's `perfType=classical` excludes correspondence at ingest time anyway, and per-position-quality / time-pressure metrics are meaningless when players have days to think.
5. **Per-(player, TC) aggregation** — both colors of every accepted game contribute one entry on each side. For each (username, TC) pair the script keeps a list of game-time Elos and a count of eval-bearing games.
6. **Eligibility floor** — a (user, TC) pair qualifies only if `eval_count_by_tc[tc] ≥ --eval-threshold` (default K=10 for bullet/blitz/rapid). Classical has a separate override `--eval-threshold-classical` (typically K=3 or lower) — classical games are rare in a single monthly dump, but classical players analyze a high fraction of their games and the 36-month ingest window in Stage 2 will pull plenty of analyzed games regardless of the selection-time threshold. Without the classical override, classical-2400 would cap out at 30–60 users vs ~1000 for the bullet/blitz/rapid 2400 cells.
7. **Per-TC ELO bucketing** — the user's ELO bucket *within a TC* is derived from the **per-TC median Elo** of their snapshot-month games in that TC, not a global median across all their TCs. This prevents misbucketing of multi-TC specialists (e.g. a 1900-blitz / 2200-classical player ends up at `1600-blitz` AND `2000-classical`, not a single conflated row). Players with per-TC median Elo `< 800` in a TC are excluded from that TC. Rating buckets are 400-wide: `800 (800–1199)`, `1200 (1200–1599)`, `1600 (1600–1999)`, `2000 (2000–2399)`, `2400 (2400+)`.
8. **Per-cell capping** — up to `--per-cell N` usernames per (rating_bucket, tc_bucket) cell (default 500). When more usernames qualify than the cap allows, the script shuffles with a fixed `random.Random(42)` seed for reproducibility before truncating.
9. **Persistence** — one row per (lichess_username, tc_bucket) into `benchmark_selected_users`, with the compound unique key matching the keying convention. The same lichess username can occupy multiple cells (one per TC where they qualified). Each row also stores `median_elo` (precise rating at snapshot), `eval_game_count` (sample-quality indicator, capped at the `SmallInteger` max), `selected_at`, and `dump_month`. Re-runs are idempotent at the (username, tc_bucket) level.

The output of Stage 1 is the *candidate pool*. It is never queried as a benchmark in its own right — many of these candidates will fail ingest in Stage 2 (404s, low yield, etc.) and only `status='completed'` rows from Stage 2 belong in any benchmark query (see the canonical CTE filter under "Standard CTE — `selected_users`" below).

#### Stage 2 — ingest via the Lichess API into the benchmark DB

`import_benchmark_users.py` walks the Stage-1 candidate pool, pulls games via the existing FlawChess import pipeline (with benchmark-specific overrides), and records every attempted (user, TC) pair's outcome in `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints`. The script is resume-friendly and slot-filling — it keeps pulling replacements until each cell hits its target or the pool is exhausted.

1. **Safety guard** — refuses to run unless `DATABASE_URL` contains `'flawchess_benchmark'` AND port `5433`, preventing accidental writes to dev/prod.
2. **Slot-filling rule** — only checkpoints with `status='completed'` AND `games_imported >= --min-games` (default 100) count toward the `--per-cell` target. The orchestrator computes per-cell deficit on every resume, then walks the pool's unattempted candidates in id order, pulling one replacement per failed/low-yield attempt until the cell is filled or the pool runs out.
3. **Stub User row** — for each candidate, the script creates a `User` row in the benchmark DB with a sentinel email (`lichess-{name}@benchmark.flawchess.local`), an invalid `hashed_password`, and `is_active=False` so the row cannot serve auth even if the benchmark DB were exposed to a login surface. This stub gives the games table a real `user_id` to FK against.
4. **Lichess fetch overrides** — the script calls the existing `import_service.run_import` with three benchmark-specific overrides:
   - `since_ms_override` = 36 months before `--snapshot-month-end` (D-13). This bypasses `get_latest_for_user_platform` so the same lichess username can be imported once per TC without the second run inheriting the first run's `last_synced_at` cursor.
   - `perf_type = tc_bucket` — Lichess returns only games in that TC bucket. The perfType filter also silently excludes correspondence, Chess960, and from-position games, which matches the benchmark's intent.
   - `max_games = 1000` per (user, TC) — server-side cap, so the long tail of users with massive game histories is never downloaded. This replaces a prior post-hoc 20k skip path; per-user-rate analytics in downstream subchapters are no longer contaminated by a handful of high-volume users.
5. **Per-(user, TC) outcomes** — every attempt produces one terminal checkpoint:
   - `completed` — `games_imported ≥ --min-games`. Fills a slot. Won't be re-attempted on resume.
   - `skipped` — successfully imported but yield below the floor (`games_imported < --min-games`). The script purges the imported games for that TC (cascade through `game_positions`); if the user has no games left across any TC, the stub `User` row is also deleted, with the checkpoint's `benchmark_user_id` FK auto-NULL'd via `ondelete=SET NULL`. Won't be re-attempted on resume, but doesn't fill a slot — the orchestrator pulls a replacement from the pool.
   - `failed` — 404 from Lichess (deleted account) or any other error. Doesn't fill a slot, won't be re-attempted.
6. **Multi-TC safety** — a user who qualified in two TCs and filled one cell but went `skipped` on the other has only the skipped TC's games purged; the user row and the completed TC's games survive.
7. **Cheat contamination** — D-01 decision: no extra filtering at this phase. Lichess's own anti-cheat bans are relied upon. Phase 70's per-class gate (rook/minor/pawn endgames) is the safety net for residual upward bias in 2000+ buckets.
8. **Resume model** — interrupting and re-running picks up exactly where the last run left off. The checkpoint table is the source of truth; `benchmark_selected_users` is read-only after Stage 1. A pool-exhausted cell (every candidate has a terminal checkpoint) can only be widened by re-running Stage 1 with looser eligibility — re-running Stage 2 alone cannot grow the cell.

The output of Stage 2 is the final benchmark dataset: `users` + `games` + `game_positions` rows for every `completed` (user, TC) pair, jointly indexable by joining `benchmark_selected_users → benchmark_ingest_checkpoints (status='completed') → users → games`. The mandatory "Standard CTE — `selected_users`" in the next subsection enforces this join in every metric query.

#### Sample-shape implications for downstream queries

A few properties of this two-stage design that every metric query must respect (and that the canonical CTE / sparse-cell rule / equal-footing filter formalize):

- **Per-user TC anchoring.** Every game in the benchmark DB has a `time_control_bucket` that may or may not match the user's selected TC. Queries MUST filter `g.time_control_bucket = bsu.tc_bucket` so a user selected for `(2000, blitz)` only contributes blitz games even if they also have rapid games in the same row. Without this filter, multi-TC qualifiers would double-count across cells.
- **Selection vs game-time rating — RATING-LAG SELECTION BIAS (resolved by game-time bucketing — see the dedicated subsection below).** `benchmark_selected_users.rating_bucket` is the per-TC median at the 2026-03 snapshot, not the rating at each game's time. It is **no longer the analysis ELO bucket** — every per-metric query now buckets by the cohort user's rating *at game time* (`games.white_rating`/`games.black_rating`). `rating_bucket` / `median_elo` are retained only as longitudinal/trajectory columns. The corrected per-color middlegame-entry eval distribution (game-time-bucketed) is in `reports/noel/opening-end-eval-by-elo-blitz-rapid-classical-gametime-2026-05-20.md` — White flat at ≈+31 cp across all five ELO buckets, Black flat at ≈−21 cp; the rating-lag-attributable component of the per-color asymmetry collapses, leaving only the documented winrate-neutral opening-style residual. Full confound mechanism, the distorted-vs-robust analysis list, the mitigation, the residual out-of-scope confounds, and the acceptance test are in the **"Rating-lag selection bias (game-time bucketing)"** subsection immediately below.
- **Pool exhaustion vs target shortfall.** `(2400, classical)` is structurally pool-exhausted at the 2026-03 dump (12 completed / 23 candidate / 0 unattempted) — there are simply not enough 2400-classical Lichess players to populate the cell. Sparse-cell exclusion (see below) formalizes the rule that this cell is kept in cell-level grids with a footnote but dropped from marginals and Cohen's d.
- **Matchmaking confound.** Higher-rated cohorts on Lichess play opponents that average 50–130 Elo weaker (worse for 2400-classical). The "Equal-footing opponent filter (all subchapters)" subsection makes the `abs(opp_rating − user_rating) ≤ 100` filter universal across every per-metric query so the resulting benchmark zones represent skill at equal footing, not skill at typical Lichess matchmaking.

### Rating-lag selection bias (game-time bucketing)

**The confound.** `benchmark_selected_users.rating_bucket` is each user's per-TC *median rating at the single 2026-03 dump month*. Every user contributes up to 1000 games per TC over a 36-month window, and Stage-1 selection additionally requires ≥10 *engine-analyzed* games in the snapshot month — which over-samples active, improving players. Bucketing all 36 months of a climbing player's games under their *final* snapshot rating files their early, underrated games into a too-high bucket. The equal-footing opponent filter equalizes *rating*, not *strength*: a climbing player's "equal-rated" opponents at the time were genuinely weaker, so the cohort out-scores a fair-coin 0.500 and the apparent ELO skill ramp is inflated. This distorts absolute zone levels and, critically, the **ELO-axis Cohen's-d collapse verdicts** — the skill's core architectural output.

**Mitigation (applied — pure SQL, existing sample, no re-ingest / no re-selection).** Every per-metric query buckets ELO by the cohort user's **rating at game time**, not the frozen snapshot rating:

```sql
-- canonical game-time ELO bucket (see "user_elo_at_game / elo_bucket" in Shared SQL building blocks)
user_elo_at_game = CASE WHEN g.user_color::text='white' THEN g.white_rating ELSE g.black_rating END
elo_bucket       = CASE WHEN user_elo_at_game < 800  THEN NULL   -- sub-800 rows dropped
                        WHEN user_elo_at_game < 1200 THEN 800
                        WHEN user_elo_at_game < 1600 THEN 1200
                        WHEN user_elo_at_game < 2000 THEN 1600
                        WHEN user_elo_at_game < 2400 THEN 2000
                        ELSE 2400 END
```

The 36-month history stays fully intact — only the bucket *label* changes from snapshot-frozen to per-game. `bsu.median_elo` / `bsu.rating_bucket` are retained as longitudinal/trajectory columns (the bias is an aggregation/labeling artifact, not a collection one). A user now spans 2–3 ELO buckets across their career; cells are `(user × game-time elo_bucket × tc_bucket)` — see "Cell anchoring (canonical)" and "Collapse verdict methodology" for the reworked per-user value model and the ≥10-users/cell floor on the new membership.

**Distorted by the old snapshot bucketing — must be regenerated under game-time bucketing:** 3.1.1 Non-EG Score, 3.1.3 Achievable Score, 3.1.4 EG Score, 3.1.5 Achievable Score Gap (absolute level), 3.2.1 Conversion/Parity/Recovery + composite Endgame Skill, 3.3.x clock/time-pressure absolute curves, 3.4.x per-endgame-class score/conv/recov, and **every ELO-axis collapse verdict** across all subchapters.

**Robust / immune (cite as the template):** 2.1's symmetric baseline (already deduplicated to physical games — the correct, already-documented mitigation); all within-user *difference* metrics where the level shift cancels in the subtraction — 3.1.6 Endgame Score Gap (`eg − non_eg`), 3.4.2/3.4.3 per-type score-gap differences. TC-axis collapse verdicts are largely unaffected (the bias is an ELO-axis phenomenon).

**Behavior change to flag:** any single whole-career per-user scalar (e.g. composite Endgame Skill per user) is no longer one number under game-time bucketing — it becomes per-bucket or a trajectory. The live-UI comparator must absorb this; report it in the regenerated report header.

**Acceptance test (must pass post-fix).** Both run against the benchmark DB, cohort = `benchmark_selected_users ⋈ users` on `lower(lichess_username)` (the current DB has games for all 5 ELO buckets but `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints` rows only for 800/1200, so the canonical checkpoint join is omitted *for the current partial-ingest DB state only* — see "Standard CTE" note):
1. **Score flat ≈0.500, no monotone ramp.** Cohort score vs equal-rated opponents (`abs(opp−user)≤100`, both NOT NULL, sparse `(2400,classical)` excluded), bucketed by game-time rating: every bucket within `0.50 ± 0.015` with no monotone rise. Contrast: the old snapshot bucketing produced the smooth ramp `800→0.496, 1200→0.505, 1600→0.506, 2000→0.523, 2400→0.538`.
2. **Per-color middlegame-entry eval mirror-symmetric.** Reproduce the 2.1 methodology (MIN(ply) where `phase=1`, drop `eval_mate` / `abs(eval_cp)≥2000`, user-POV signed) but bucket by game-time rating: the rating-lag-attributable component of the per-color asymmetry collapses (contrast: old snapshot bucketing gave the asymmetric 1200 White ≈ +33 / Black ≈ −16).

**Residual, out of scope (do NOT chase by relaxing filters / re-collecting):**
- **2000/2400 score residual.** After game-time bucketing the 800–1600 region flattens to ≈0.504–0.508 (ramp removed) but 2000/2400 retain ≈0.52–0.53. This upward drift is partly **cheat contamination** — `scripts/select_benchmark_users.py` D-01 applies no cheat-filtering. It is **not** a bucketing defect and is **not** SQL-fixable here; it is a distinct concern handled by the Phase-70 per-class gate / TOS-ban exclusion. Keep it separate when validating.
- **Per-color opening-style residual.** Game-time bucketing removes the rating-lag-attributable half of the per-color asymmetry; a small **winrate-neutral opening-style residual** (~+4–7 cp midpoint, mid-ELO) remains. It is a selection-membership artifact of the ≥10-analyzed-games eligibility, not SQL-fixable — document, do not re-collect.

These two residuals are why acceptance tests 1 and 2 are read as "the rating-lag-attributable bias is removed", not "every bucket hits the literal ±0.015 / mirror-exact threshold". A clean numerical threshold cannot be met without cheat-filtering and re-selection, both explicitly out of scope for this fix.

### Target

- **Benchmark DB only** (`mcp__flawchess-benchmark-db__query`). Population baselines are computed against the stratified Lichess sample, never against FlawChess prod/dev data.
- Benchmark DB runs in Docker on `localhost:5433`. If `docker compose -p flawchess-benchmark ps` shows nothing, run `bin/benchmark_db.sh start` first.
- Each MCP call runs one statement (no `;`-separated multi-statement).

### Cell anchoring (canonical)

The **TC** axis anchors on `benchmark_selected_users.tc_bucket` (selection-time, stable per row). The **ELO** axis anchors on the cohort user's **rating at game time** (`games.white_rating`/`games.black_rating`), NOT on `benchmark_selected_users.rating_bucket` — see "Rating-lag selection bias (game-time bucketing)" above for why the snapshot bucket is a material confound. `rating_bucket` / `median_elo` are kept only as longitudinal/trajectory columns.

#### Schema

```
benchmark_selected_users
  id                  integer (PK)
  lichess_username    varchar  -- joins to users.lichess_username
  rating_bucket       smallint -- selection-snapshot bucket — LONGITUDINAL ONLY, not the analysis ELO bucket
  tc_bucket           varchar  -- 'bullet' / 'blitz' / 'rapid' / 'classical' (the TC axis anchor)
  median_elo          smallint -- precise rating at 2026-03 selection time (longitudinal/trajectory only)
  eval_game_count     smallint -- snapshot eval-bearing game count (sample quality)
  selected_at         timestamptz
  dump_month          varchar  -- provenance (currently '2026-03' for all rows)
```

#### Cell rules

- **20 cells**: 5 ELO buckets × 4 TC buckets. ELO anchors are `800 (800–1199), 1200 (1200–1599), 1600 (1600–1999), 2000 (2000–2399), 2400 (2400+)`, applied to the cohort user's **rating at game time** (`<800` rows dropped). A single user spans **2–3 ELO buckets across their career** — they are a distinct cell member in each `(game-time elo_bucket, tc_bucket)` they have ≥ the per-user game floor in. "ELO bucket effect" now means a genuine rating-at-game-time effect, not a snapshot-cohort effect.
- **Per-user TC anchoring**: one user can occupy multiple TC cells, one per TC where they qualified at selection time (compound `(lichess_username, tc_bucket)` key). Each row contributes only its TC's games via `g.time_control_bucket::text = su.tc_bucket`. A user in `(bullet)` and `(classical)` is scored on each TC's games independently, then further split by their game-time ELO bucket within each TC.
- **Per-user history caveat**: each user contributes up to 1000 games per TC (`max=1000` cap on the lichess API at ingest time), bounded by a 36-month window before the selection snapshot. Their rating varies across that window, so their games distribute across 2–3 game-time ELO buckets. `bsu.median_elo` / `bsu.rating_bucket` remain available as longitudinal/trajectory columns (e.g. selection-vs-game-time drift analysis) but MUST NOT be used as the analysis ELO bucket. Surface the game-time-bucketing methodology change in the report header.
- **Selection vs ingest**: per-cell selection target is `--per-cell` (typically 100–500). Multi-TC qualifiers add a small amount of incidental cross-cell membership (~0–10 users per ELO bucket overlap two cells). All cells should clear the ≥10 users/cell floor after ingest; verify with the sample-size query below.
- **Checkpoint-status filter (mandatory)**: the canonical CTE MUST join `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints` and filter `bic.status = 'completed'`. `benchmark_selected_users` is the *candidate pool*, not the ingested set — it includes rows that were never attempted (`null` checkpoint), 404'd / errored on import (`failed`), or fell below the `--min-games` ingest floor (`skipped`, with their games purged but stub `users` row preserved if a sibling TC filled). Without this filter, multi-TC qualifiers leak into queries with zero games for the unselected TC, dragging medians to zero. See "Sparse-cell exclusion" below.
- **Selection provenance**: 2026-03 Lichess monthly dump (single `dump_month` for the current DB). When new dumps land, group by `dump_month` so cross-snapshot drift is observable.

#### Standard CTE — `selected_users`

Every query starts with:

```sql
WITH selected_users AS (
  SELECT u.id AS user_id, bsu.tc_bucket,
         bsu.rating_bucket AS selection_rating_bucket,  -- LONGITUDINAL ONLY (not the analysis bucket)
         bsu.median_elo, bsu.eval_game_count
  FROM benchmark_selected_users bsu
  JOIN benchmark_ingest_checkpoints bic
    ON bic.lichess_username = bsu.lichess_username
   AND bic.tc_bucket = bsu.tc_bucket
   AND bic.status = 'completed'
  JOIN users u ON u.lichess_username = bsu.lichess_username
)
```

Then JOIN `selected_users su` on `g.user_id = su.user_id` and filter `g.time_control_bucket::text = su.tc_bucket`. **The ELO axis is NOT `su.selection_rating_bucket`** — every per-metric query derives `elo_bucket` per-game from the cohort user's rating at game time via the canonical `user_elo_at_game` / `elo_bucket` building block (see "Shared SQL building blocks"), and drops sub-800 rows. Cells are `(game-time elo_bucket, su.tc_bucket)`. **Cast note**: `games.time_control_bucket` is a custom enum (`timecontrolbucket`) and `benchmark_selected_users.tc_bucket` is `varchar` — without the `::text` cast Postgres errors with `operator does not exist: timecontrolbucket = character varying`.

**Current-DB-state checkpoint exception**: the checkpoint join below is the correct canonical rule for a fully-ingested benchmark DB. When the DB has games for ELO buckets whose `benchmark_ingest_checkpoints` rows have not been written (e.g. the present state: games for all 5 buckets but checkpoints only for 800/1200), the checkpoint join silently drops the unattested buckets. In that state only, link the cohort as `benchmark_selected_users ⋈ users ON lower(u.lichess_username)=lower(bsu.lichess_username)` with **no checkpoint join**, and note the deviation in the report header. Restore the checkpoint join once Stage-2 checkpoints are complete.

**Why the checkpoint join is non-optional**: `benchmark_selected_users` is the candidate *pool*. The ingest orchestrator (`scripts/import_benchmark_users.py`) walks the pool, marking each `(lichess_username, tc_bucket)` row as `completed`, `skipped` (low yield, games purged), `failed` (404/error), or leaving it `null` (never attempted because earlier candidates filled the slot). Only `completed` rows have games in this TC. Skipping the filter pulls in 'skipped' multi-TC qualifiers (whose games for this TC were deleted) and never-attempted pool members, both of which appear as 0-game users in cell aggregates.

#### Sample size check

Verify cell coverage (count of `status='completed'` users) before running a full report:

```sql
SELECT bsu.rating_bucket, bsu.tc_bucket, COUNT(DISTINCT u.id) AS users_completed
FROM benchmark_selected_users bsu
JOIN benchmark_ingest_checkpoints bic
  ON bic.lichess_username = bsu.lichess_username
 AND bic.tc_bucket = bsu.tc_bucket
 AND bic.status = 'completed'
JOIN users u ON u.lichess_username = bsu.lichess_username
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2, 1;
```

Optionally also report the full status breakdown to spot pool exhaustion:

```sql
SELECT bsu.rating_bucket, bsu.tc_bucket,
       COALESCE(bic.status, 'unattempted') AS status,
       COUNT(*) AS n
FROM benchmark_selected_users bsu
LEFT JOIN benchmark_ingest_checkpoints bic
  ON bic.lichess_username = bsu.lichess_username
 AND bic.tc_bucket = bsu.tc_bucket
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 2, 1, 3;
```

A cell is **pool-exhausted** when `unattempted = 0` and `completed < target`. Topping up via re-running the orchestrator does nothing — the only fix is widening selection criteria in `select_benchmark_users.py` and re-running selection.

The two queries above use `bsu.rating_bucket` deliberately: they measure **selection-pool coverage** (a selection-time property), not analysis-cell membership. Analysis cells are now game-time-bucketed, so before a report also verify the **game-time cell sizes** actually clearing the per-user floors:

```sql

A game-time cell with `< 10` users (after the subchapter's per-user game floor) is footnoted and excluded from that metric's marginals exactly like the sparse `(2400, classical)` cell.

#### Eval coverage check

Subchapters 3.1.2 / 3.1.3 / 3.2.1 / 3.4.1 depend on Stockfish eval being present at the first endgame ply. Coverage should be ~100% on the benchmark DB. If it dips below 99% the report header should flag it (NULL eval routes to parity, biasing the parity bucket).

```sql
WITH first_endgame AS (
  SELECT game_id, min(ply) AS entry_ply
  FROM game_positions
  WHERE endgame_class IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY game_id HAVING count(*) >= 6
)
SELECT
  count(*) AS endgame_games,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE ep.eval_cp IS NOT NULL OR ep.eval_mate IS NOT NULL) AS with_eval,
  round(100.0 * count(*) FILTER (WHERE ep.eval_cp IS NOT NULL OR ep.eval_mate IS NOT NULL) / count(*), 2) AS pct_with_eval
FROM first_endgame fe
JOIN game_positions ep ON ep.game_id = fe.game_id AND ep.ply = fe.entry_ply;
```

#### Sparse-cell exclusion

**Known sparse cell**: `(rating_bucket=2400, tc_bucket='classical')` is structurally undersampled and pool-exhausted as of the 2026-03 dump (12 completed users out of a 23-user pool, ~55 games/user vs ~900 in 2400-bullet). This is a property of the Lichess 2400-classical population (low player count × low games-per-player), not a fixable ingestion gap.

**Rule**: this cell **MUST be excluded from cross-axis aggregations** (TC marginals, ELO marginals, pooled overall, and Cohen's d on either axis) but **kept in cell-level 5×4 tables** for transparency. Add a footnote to the cell value and to every report header.

**Implementation pattern**: when computing marginals or pooled values, gate the aggregation:

```sql
-- Marginal / pooled aggregation: exclude the sparse cell
... WHERE NOT (elo_bucket = 2400 AND tc = 'classical') ...

-- Cell-level 5×4 grid: keep the cell, render with a footnote (e.g. "n=12*")
```

The Cohen's d marginal pools must apply the same exclusion — both the per-level `(n, mean, var)` aggregates and any pairwise comparisons it feeds. A 2400-row of an ELO-axis Cohen's d that includes (2400, classical) at n=12 would be statistically dominated by the other three TCs anyway, but mixing the sparse cell in distorts the variance estimate at the marginal level.

**Future extensions of this skill (new subchapters, new metrics) MUST honor this exclusion**: any new query that computes a TC marginal, ELO marginal, pooled overall, or Cohen's d input must apply the `NOT (elo_bucket = 2400 AND tc = 'classical')` filter at the marginal aggregation stage. Cell-level outputs should still include the cell with a footnote. If a future Lichess dump produces a denser 2400-classical cell (e.g. ≥40 completed users with ≥200 games/user), revisit this rule and document the change in the report header.

### Collapse verdict methodology (Cohen's d)

Per metric, answer: does this metric collapse across TC? across ELO? both? neither?

#### Computation

For each per-user metric:

1. Compute one value per **`(user_id, game-time elo_bucket, tc_bucket)`** — a user with games across 2–3 game-time ELO buckets contributes a separate value in each bucket they clear the subchapter's per-user game floor in (they are independent observations: different games, different rating regime). The unit of analysis is the per-(user, elo_bucket, tc) value, not the user. Floor: ≥10 such values per cell for inclusion (footnote cells below floor; the per-user game floor already gates thin (user, bucket) slices out).
2. **TC marginal**: 4 levels (bullet/blitz/rapid/classical) — pool the per-(user, elo_bucket, tc) values across ELO within each TC. **Exclude `(elo_bucket=2400, tc='classical')` values from the classical pool** (see "Sparse-cell exclusion").
3. **ELO marginal**: 5 levels (800/1200/1600/2000/2400, game-time) — pool values across TC within each ELO. **Exclude `(elo_bucket=2400, tc='classical')` values from the 2400 pool** for the same reason. Because a user can appear in adjacent ELO marginals (different games), ELO-axis `d` now measures a genuine rating-at-game-time contrast rather than a frozen-snapshot-cohort contrast — this is the corrected core verdict.
4. Compute pairwise Cohen's d on user-level distributions:
   - TC axis: 4 levels → 6 pairs → take **`max |d|`** (`tc_d_max`).
   - ELO axis: 5 levels → 10 pairs → take **`max |d|`** (`elo_d_max`).
5. Cohen's d formula: `d = (mean_a - mean_b) / pooled_sd`, where `pooled_sd = sqrt(((n_a - 1) * var_a + (n_b - 1) * var_b) / (n_a + n_b - 2))`.

#### Verdict thresholds (hard-coded)

| `max |d|` | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| < 0.2 | **collapse** | Negligible. Single global zone is fine. |
| 0.2 ≤ d < 0.5 | **review** | Small but noticeable. Default to single zone unless a UI argument warrants splitting. |
| ≥ 0.5 | **keep separate** | Meaningful. Stratify zones along this axis. |

Each axis is evaluated independently; a metric can land at "collapse on TC, keep ELO" or vice versa.

#### Why marginals not all-cell pairwise

Pairwise on all 20 cells over-rejects collapse on outlier cells. Marginal-pair max d directly answers "does this dimension matter?".

#### Why Cohen's d not gauge-range relative

Gauge ranges in `theme.ts` were chosen with varying degrees of arbitrariness. Cohen's d is standardized in within-group SD units and gauge-range-independent.

#### Computing Cohen's d in SQL

For a per-user value column `x` over a marginal axis (e.g. TC), produce per-level `(n, mean, var)` then compute pairwise d in post-processing. SQL fragment:

```sql
SELECT axis_level, count(*) AS n, avg(x) AS mean_x, var_samp(x) AS var_x
FROM per_user_values
GROUP BY axis_level
HAVING count(*) >= 10;
```

Then for each pair `(a, b)`: `pooled_sd = sqrt(((n_a-1)*var_a + (n_b-1)*var_b) / (n_a+n_b-2))`; `d = (mean_a - mean_b) / pooled_sd`. Take `max(|d|)` across pairs as the axis verdict input.

#### Per-metric output block (every subchapter)

**Mandatory tables per metric (where applicable):** every per-user metric subchapter MUST emit three tables in this order:

1. **p50 cell table** — 5×4 grid (rows = ELO bucket, cols = TC). Cell = per-user `p50 (n_users)`. Sparse `(2400, classical)` cell shown with footnote. This is the headline visual.
2. **ELO marginal** — 5 rows (800/1200/1600/2000/2400) pooled across TC, excluding the sparse cell. Columns: `n_users / mean / SD / p25 / p50 / p75` (plus `p05 / p95` for distributions with wide tails).
3. **TC marginal** — 4 rows (bullet/blitz/rapid/classical) pooled across ELO, excluding the sparse cell. Same columns.

Plus a **pooled distribution table** (single row: `n / mean / SD / p05 / p25 / p50 / p75 / p95`) — the one that feeds the cohort-band recommendation. This is the fourth mandatory table for every per-user metric.

Then the collapse verdict block:

```
### Collapse verdict
- TC axis: max |d| = X.XX (between {pair}) → {collapse | review | keep}
- ELO axis: max |d| = Y.YY (between {pair}) → {collapse | review | keep}
```

Score heatmaps render as percent; eval heatmaps render as integer cp (e.g. `+25 / −10 / +18 / +4`); score-gap heatmaps render as `pp` per the display-formatting rules above.

**"Where applicable" exceptions:** subchapters with intrinsically different structure (e.g. 3.4.1 / 3.4.2 / 3.4.3 partition by endgame class; 3.3.2 partitions by time-pressure bucket; 3.2.2 partitions by entry bucket) emit the per-partition equivalent — one p50 cell table + ELO marginal + TC marginal **per partition** (class / bucket / time-bin). The principle is unconditional: the reader must always see the cell-level p50 grid plus both marginals for every metric, just sliced by the subchapter's natural partition. Sub-table suppression for cells below `n_users` floor is fine; skipping marginals entirely is not.

##### Rendering rule — MARKDOWN TABLES, NOT PROSE LISTS (hard rule)

The p50 cell grid, ELO marginal, TC marginal, and pooled distribution MUST be rendered as **GitHub-flavored markdown tables** (pipe-delimited, header + `---` separator row). Do **NOT** collapse them into single-line prose summaries like `ELO marginal (cp): 800 n764 m0 SD88 · 1200 n1093 m+7 SD70 · …`. The middle-dot bullet form is unscannable, defeats column alignment, and silently drops most of the per-level statistics (p25/p75/p05/p95). Every numeric breakdown that has a row/column structure goes into a markdown table — there is no token-budget exception. If the recommendation prose still fits, the tables fit too.

**Canonical templates** (use as drop-in skeletons — copy the column set verbatim, fill in the values):

Pooled distribution (1 row):

```markdown
| n | mean | SD | p05 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p95 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2,025 | 52.1% | 7.5% | 38.4% | 46.4% | 51.9% | 57.2% | 66.9% |
```

ELO marginal (5 rows, sparse-excluded):

```markdown
| ELO | n | mean | SD | p05 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p95 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 800 | 342 | 51.7% | 6.8% | 40.1% | 47.2% | 51.8% | 56.5% | 64.4% |
| 1200 | 484 | 51.9% | 7.2% | … | 46.4% | 51.9% | 56.8% | … |
| 1600 | 501 | 51.7% | 7.0% | … | 45.4% | 51.5% | 56.8% | … |
| 2000 | 414 | 52.8% | 7.4% | … | 47.1% | 52.3% | 58.4% | … |
| 2400 | 262 | 52.3% | 7.3% | … | 46.8% | 52.3% | 57.9% | … |
```

TC marginal (4 rows, sparse-excluded):

```markdown
| TC | n | mean | SD | p05 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p95 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| bullet | 614 | 51.2% | … | … | 46.3% | 51.2% | 56.1% | … |
| blitz | 611 | 51.7% | … | … | 46.0% | 51.8% | 56.8% | … |
| rapid | 584 | 52.6% | … | … | 46.7% | 52.2% | 58.1% | … |
| classical | 194 | 54.4% | … | … | 47.8% | 53.9% | 61.5% | … |
```

p50 cell grid (5×4 with `p50 (n_users)`):

```markdown
| ELO \ TC | bullet | blitz | rapid | classical |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 800 | 51.0 (137) | 51.5 (126) | 52.1 (162) | 53.0 (140) |
| 1200 | … | … | … | … |
| 1600 | … | … | … | … |
| 2000 | … | … | … | … |
| 2400 | … | … | … | 53.0 (6)* |
```

`p05/p95` columns can be omitted from marginal tables for tight-distribution metrics (Cohen's d / score) but MUST be included for wide-tail distributions (eval cp, score gaps in pp). When in doubt, include them.

For multi-metric subchapters (e.g. 3.2.1 Conv/Parity/Recovery — 4 metrics × 3 tables = 12 tables), emit all 12. Prose summaries can accompany the tables, but never replace them. The headline collapse-verdict summary table (chapter end) is a separate deliverable and does NOT substitute for per-subchapter marginals.

**Prose is reserved for** narrative interpretation (what the numbers mean, recommendations, caveats), not for transmitting the numbers themselves. If you find yourself writing `metric (unit): level1 statA · level2 statA · …`, stop and emit a markdown table instead.

### Equal-footing opponent filter (all subchapters)

**Apply `abs(opp_rating - user_rating) <= 100` to every per-game CTE across all per-metric subchapters in Chapters 2 and 3.** No exceptions — the filter is part of the canonical "Base filter" alongside `g.rated AND NOT g.is_computer_game`.

#### Why

Without the filter, the 2400 cohort plays opponents averaging 50–130 Elo weaker (and 2400-classical is even more skewed). That matchmaking confound inflates the apparent ELO skill ramp on every per-game metric and makes cohort differences look larger than they actually are. The 2026-05-03 report measured per-cell `avg_opp_minus_user` ranging from +47 (800-classical) down to -372 (2400-classical) — see that report's opponent-gap analysis section.

The filter was originally scoped to Conv/Par/Recov and Endgame-type metrics only, on the argument that within-user-diff (score gap), clock behavior, and time-pressure-vs-performance were less skill-stratified. Decision revisited 2026-05-03: methodological consistency wins. The per-time-bucket score curve is genuinely confounded by matchmaking; the score-gap timeline Y-axis uses absolute eg/non_eg percentiles that are also inflated; the net-timeout-rate is partly "I beat weaker players on time." Single rule, single rationale, simpler header.

#### Framing — design decision

Benchmark zones are calibrated as the **"skill at equal footing"** baseline. The user's measured value in the live UI still uses unfiltered games (their real performance, including any matchmaking advantage), but the zones it's compared against are confound-free. Higher-rated players will naturally see their measurement sit above the equal-footing baseline — *that* is the intended signal. Users who want to view skill-only stats apply the in-app opponent-strength filter, which collapses their measurement to the equal-footing comparator. Full rationale in `.planning/notes/benchmark-equal-footing-framing.md`.

#### Sample-loss escape hatch

The filter retains ~85–90% of mid-ELO games but drops 2400-rapid to ~51% and 2400-classical to ~15% (already excluded as sparse cell). If a non-sparse cell drops below per-user sample floors after filtering:

1. **First-line fix**: re-run selection with a higher per-cell user target via `select_benchmark_users.py --per-cell N`, then re-ingest. The benchmark DB is meant to be re-populated, not preserved.
2. **Second-line fix**: widen the per-user game window in `import_benchmark_users.py` (currently capped at 1000 games / 36-month window per TC).
3. **Last resort**: footnote the cell with reduced n and exclude from marginals. Do NOT relax the equal-footing tolerance below ±100 Elo just to keep games — the whole point is the equal-footing baseline.

Track post-filter sample sizes per subchapter in the equal-footing retention subsection. Flag any cell that drops below floor.

#### SQL fragment

In every per-game CTE (across all subchapters), the filter goes alongside the existing `g.rated AND NOT g.is_computer_game` clause:

```sql
WHERE g.rated AND NOT g.is_computer_game
  AND g.time_control_bucket::text = su.tc_bucket
  AND g.white_rating IS NOT NULL AND g.black_rating IS NOT NULL
  AND abs(
        (CASE WHEN g.user_color='white' THEN g.white_rating ELSE g.black_rating END)
      - (CASE WHEN g.user_color='white' THEN g.black_rating ELSE g.white_rating END)
      ) <= 100
```

Both rating columns must be NOT NULL — the abs() expression silently returns NULL if either side is missing, and a NULL-comparing predicate evaluates to NULL (drops the row), but explicitly stating the NOT NULL keeps the intent legible and prevents accidental interaction with future SQL refactors.

#### Reporting

Add an "Equal-footing retention" subsection under each subchapter's cell coverage (every subchapter, not just Conv/Par/Recov and Endgame-type), showing the per-cell game retention vs the unfiltered baseline. The 2026-05-03 retention pattern was: mid-ELO cells retain ~85–90%, 2400-rapid drops to ~51%, 2400-classical to ~15% (already excluded as sparse cell). Flag any cell that drops below the per-user sample floor and apply the escape-hatch fix above.

When comparing against pre-2026-05-03 snapshots, note in the report header that the score-gap / clock / time-pressure metrics changed from unfiltered to equal-footing — the absolute numbers are not directly comparable across the boundary.

### Score-gap re-centering — out of scope

Score-gap gauge currently uses symmetric `±0.10` (i.e. ±10pp). **Do not propose re-centering for sub-5pp population median offsets** — round bounds beat data-fitted asymmetry below that threshold. (2026-04-30 design decision.)

### Display formatting (universal — all report tables and recommendations)

The benchmark SQL is internally consistent — score columns return proportions in `[0, 1]` (e.g. `0.4873`), score-diff columns return signed proportions (e.g. `-0.0231`), eval columns return centipawns with sub-integer precision (e.g. `25.42`). These are **internal units**; the report's *rendered* tables and recommendation prose MUST apply the following display rules:

- **Score values** (per-user `eg_score`, `non_eg_score`, `entry_xs`, per-class score, per-bucket conv/par/recov rates, all percentile columns derived from a score) → render as **percent with one decimal** (e.g. `48.7%`, not `0.487`). Multiply by 100 in post-processing; never edit the SQL just to bake in the unit.
- **Score gaps / differences** (per-user `eg_score − non_eg_score`, `achievable_score_gap = actual − expected`, per-class `score_diff = 2·score − 1`, etc.) → render in **percentage points with one decimal** (e.g. `−2.3pp`, `+1.0pp`). Use `pp` not `%` so the reader doesn't confuse a 5pp gap with a 5% relative effect.
- **Cohen's d** → render to **2 decimals** (e.g. `0.42`). Already unit-free.
- **Eval values** (centipawns at MG entry / EG entry, including baselines, means, SDs, and all percentile columns derived from eval) → render as **integer cp**, signed for delta/diff values (e.g. `+25 cp`, `−418 cp`, `SD = 238 cp`). Round-half-to-even.
- **Pawn-unit eval bullets** (live constants in `endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` are in pawns) — when comparing to live constants, render both in their native unit: live constant in pawns (e.g. `±0.75 pawns`), measured value in pawns derived from `cp / 100` rounded to 2 decimals (e.g. `±0.42 pawns`). This is the one exception to "evals as integer cp" — keep the pawn unit when comparing to a pawn-unit constant.
- **Sample sizes (`n`)** → integer, no thousands separators unless ≥ 100,000 (then use commas e.g. `1,250,431`).
- **Clock-diff %, time-pressure curves, net-timeout rate** → already in percent units in the SQL (multiplied by 100 inside the query). Render with one decimal, append `%` for absolute and `pp` for diffs (e.g. `−1.5%`, `+4.2pp` net timeout).

**Why not bake into SQL.** Scaling `score * 100` inside the SQL changes the variance returned by `var_samp(...)` by a factor of 10,000, which would silently break Cohen's d computations that pass the raw `var_samp` column. Keeping SQL in proportion-units preserves drop-in compatibility with the Cohen's d recipe in "Computing Cohen's d in SQL" (d is unit-invariant under linear scaling — both numerator and `pooled_sd` scale together — but only if the formatter is consistent). Apply formatting at the rendering layer.

**Code constants are quoted in their native unit.** Live constants such as `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN = -0.05` are literal codebase values — when documenting them in "Currently set in code" tables, quote the literal (`−0.05`). In adjacent narrative prose, the same value can be paraphrased as `−5pp` to match the rendering rule. When recommending a *new* value, use display units (e.g. "widen `SCORE_GAP_DOMAIN` from `0.20` to `0.23` (= ±23pp)") and let the implementer convert back to the native unit during the code edit.

### Live-threshold grep table

Before running each subchapter, grep the code for the constants the subchapter's gauge depends on. Record literal values in a "Currently set in code" subsection so recommendations compare data-driven proposals against the live values.

| Subchapter | Metric | File | Constants |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Middlegame-entry eval | `frontend/src/lib/openingStatsZones.ts` (MG-entry bullet). For the **symmetric engine-asymmetry baseline** (live z-test, MG only), `app/services/opening_insights_constants.py`. `EVAL_BASELINE_PAWNS_BLACK` must equal `-EVAL_BASELINE_PAWNS_WHITE` (symmetric by construction — flag if violated). | `EVAL_NEUTRAL_MIN_PAWNS = -0.30`, `EVAL_NEUTRAL_MAX_PAWNS = +0.30`, `EVAL_BULLET_DOMAIN_PAWNS = 1.5`. Baseline: `EVAL_BASELINE_PAWNS_WHITE = 0.25`, `EVAL_BASELINE_PAWNS_BLACK = -0.25`, `EVAL_CONFIDENCE_MIN_N = 20` (re-grep at run time). |
| 3.1.2 | Endgame-entry eval (pawns, EG-entry "Where you start" tile) | `frontend/src/lib/endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` | `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_NEUTRAL_MIN_PAWNS = -0.75`, `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_NEUTRAL_MAX_PAWNS = +0.75`, `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_DOMAIN_PAWNS = 2.0`, `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_CENTER = 0`. **EG-entry tile is 0-centered** (null = 0, no baseline subtraction) — unlike the MG-entry tile which centers on the symmetric ±baseline. Calibration recommendations feed `endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` directly from the **uncentered** distribution; do not center against the EG pass-1 baseline when calibrating the EG bullet. |
| 3.1.3 | Achievable Score (Stockfish-predicted expected score at EG entry) | `app/services/endgame_zones.py` → generated `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts` | `entry_expected_score` ZoneSpec; `ENTRY_EXPECTED_SCORE_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX`, `entryExpectedScoreZoneColor()` (generated). |
| 3.1.4 | Endgame score (per-user, EG-only) | `frontend/src/lib/scoreBulletConfig.ts` (shared with Openings score bullet) | `SCORE_BULLET_CENTER = 0.5`, `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN = -0.05`, `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MAX = +0.05`, `SCORE_BULLET_DOMAIN = 0.25`. The score bullet config is shared across surfaces; 3.1.4 calibrates the **endgame-only** subset of users that the "What you do with it" tile reads. |
| 3.1.5 | Achievable Score Gap (per-user `actual − expected`) | `frontend/src/components/charts/EndgamePerformanceSection.tsx` (Endgame Score Differences row) | `ACHIEVABLE_SCORE_GAP_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX`, `ACHIEVABLE_SCORE_GAP_DOMAIN` (re-grep — names may have evolved with Phase 85.1) |
| 3.1.6 | Endgame Score Gap and Timeline (per-user `eg − non_eg`) | `frontend/src/components/charts/EndgamePerformanceSection.tsx` | `SCORE_GAP_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX`, `SCORE_GAP_DOMAIN`, `SCORE_TIMELINE_Y_DOMAIN`, any `SCORE_TIMELINE_NEUTRAL_*` constants |
| 3.2.1 | Conv / Par / Recov + Endgame Skill | `frontend/src/components/charts/EndgameScoreGapSection.tsx`, `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts` | `FIXED_GAUGE_ZONES`, `NEUTRAL_ZONE_MIN/MAX`, `BULLET_DOMAIN`, `ENDGAME_SKILL_ZONES` |

| §3.3.3 | Chess score per pressure bin | `app/services/endgame_zones.py` → generated `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts` | `PRESSURE_BIN_SCORE_NEUTRAL_ZONES` (nested dict by tc/quintile); `PRESSURE_BIN_NEUTRAL_CAP = 0.06`. Placeholder: all bands `(-0.06, 0.06)`. |
| 3.4.1 | Per-class chess-score bullet + conv/recov gauges | `frontend/src/components/charts/EndgameTypeCard.tsx`, `EndgameTypeBreakdownSection.tsx`, `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/scoreBulletConfig.ts` | Score bullet uses GLOBAL `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX` (0.45/0.55) + `SCORE_BULLET_CENTER` (no per-class zones yet — see 3.4.1 recommendations); gauges use per-class IQR-derived `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES.{class}.{conversion,recovery}` |
| 3.4.2 | Per-span Score Gap by endgame type (per-type card "Score Gap" bullet — Phase 87.1) | `app/services/endgame_zones.py` → generated `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts`; consumed by `frontend/src/components/charts/EndgameTypeCard.tsx` (Plan 03) | `endgame_type_achievable_score_gap` ZoneSpec; `ENDGAME_TYPE_SCORE_GAP_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX`; `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES.{class}.achievable_score_gap`. Placeholder bands `(-0.05, 0.05)` shipped in Phase 87.1 Plan 01; calibrate per this subchapter then update both registry entries and regenerate. |

### Shared SQL building blocks

#### `endgame_game_ids`
Games meeting the 6-ply endgame rule (`ENDGAME_PLY_THRESHOLD = 6`):
```sql
SELECT game_id FROM game_positions
WHERE endgame_class IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY game_id HAVING count(*) >= 6
```

#### `first_endgame`
First endgame ply per qualifying game:
```sql
SELECT game_id, min(ply) AS entry_ply
FROM game_positions
WHERE endgame_class IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY game_id HAVING count(*) >= 6
```

#### `user_score_expr`
User's score in a game:
```sql
CASE
  WHEN (g.result = '1-0' AND g.user_color = 'white')
    OR (g.result = '0-1' AND g.user_color = 'black') THEN 1.0
  WHEN g.result = '1/2-1/2' THEN 0.5
  ELSE 0.0
END
```

#### `user_elo_at_game` / `elo_bucket` (game-time ELO — canonical, replaces `su.rating_bucket`)

The cohort user's own rating **in that game**, bucketed with the same 400-wide anchors. This is the single source of truth for the ELO axis in **every** per-metric query (Chapters 2 and 3). Add `user_elo_at_game` to each per-game CTE and derive `elo_bucket` from it; sub-800 rows are dropped (NULL bucket). Never alias `su.selection_rating_bucket` / `su.rating_bucket` as `elo_bucket`.

```sql
-- in every per-game CTE (the games-filter CTE that joins selected_users su):
(CASE WHEN g.user_color::text = 'white' THEN g.white_rating ELSE g.black_rating END) AS user_elo_at_game

-- elo_bucket from user_elo_at_game (alias it `ueag` if projected, else inline the CASE-WHEN):
CASE WHEN user_elo_at_game < 800  THEN NULL
     WHEN user_elo_at_game < 1200 THEN 800
     WHEN user_elo_at_game < 1600 THEN 1200
     WHEN user_elo_at_game < 2000 THEN 1600
     WHEN user_elo_at_game < 2400 THEN 2000
     ELSE 2400 END AS elo_bucket
```

- **Drop sub-800 / NULL**: add `WHERE user_elo_at_game >= 800` (equivalently `elo_bucket IS NOT NULL`) at the projection that introduces the bucket. Both `g.white_rating` and `g.black_rating` are already required NOT NULL by the equal-footing filter, so `user_elo_at_game` is never NULL once that filter is applied; the `>= 800` guard drops only legitimately sub-800 games.
- **Cells = `(elo_bucket, su.tc_bucket)`**, membership per-game. A user contributes to every bucket they have ≥ the subchapter's per-user game floor in (2–3 buckets typical). Per-user metric values are computed **per `(user_id, elo_bucket, tc)`**, not once per user — `GROUP BY user_id, elo_bucket, tc` everywhere a per-user value is formed.
- **Longitudinal columns stay available**: keep `su.median_elo` (and, if a trajectory analysis needs it, `su.selection_rating_bucket`) as extra non-grouping columns; they are never the analysis bucket.
- **Sparse-cell + equal-footing rules unchanged**: the `NOT (elo_bucket = 2400 AND tc = 'classical')` marginal exclusion and the `abs(opp−user) ≤ 100` equal-footing filter apply exactly as before, now keyed on the game-time `elo_bucket`.

#### Base filter
Every query: `g.rated AND NOT g.is_computer_game` PLUS the **equal-footing opponent filter** (`abs(opp_rating - user_rating) <= 100`, both ratings NOT NULL). The equal-footing filter is universal across every per-metric subchapter in Chapters 2 and 3 — see "Equal-footing opponent filter (all subchapters)" for SQL fragment and rationale. Do not apply `recency` filters — population stats are unconstrained by per-user UI filters.

#### Sample floors

| Subchapter | Per-user / per-cell minimum |
|---|---|
| 2.1 MG-entry eval / 3.1.2 EG-entry eval | ≥20 games per user with continuous in-domain eval at the entry ply (matches `EVAL_CONFIDENCE_MIN_N = 20`) |
| 3.1.2 EG-entry eval (cell-level) | cell shown if ≥10 users (same as Cohen's d floor) |
| 3.1.3 Achievable Score (per-user) | ≥20 endgame games per user per cell |

| 3.1.6 Endgame Score Gap and Timeline | ≥30 endgame AND ≥30 non-endgame games per user (in their selected TC) |
| 3.2.1 Conv/Par/Recov pooled | cell shown if pooled n ≥ 100 |
| 3.2.1 Endgame Skill per-user | ≥20 endgame games per user, ≥2 of 3 material buckets non-empty; cell shown if ≥10 users |

| 3.3.2 pressure-vs-performance | per-(TC × time-bucket) cell shown if n ≥ 100 |
| 3.4.1 endgame-type | per-(cell × class): n ≥ 100 for score, ≥30 for conversion / recovery |
| Cohen's d | ≥10 users per marginal level |

## 2. Openings

Calibrations that feed the Openings page. Currently the only Openings-page metric this skill calibrates is **middlegame-entry eval**, which drives the Openings tab's MG-entry bullet via `frontend/src/lib/openingStatsZones.ts` and powers the live z-test in `app/services/opening_insights_constants.py`.

### 2.1 Middlegame-entry eval

**Question:** At the first ply of the middlegame, how does the per-(user, color) Stockfish eval distribute *after centering on a symmetric ±BASELINE*? The output calibrates the bullet chart's neutral and domain bounds for per-(user, opening, color) cells, where the live z-test runs `delta = signed_user_pov_eval − baseline_C` (Phase 80 area).

The shared symmetric-baseline methodology in this subchapter is referenced by **3.1.2 Endgame-entry eval** — that subchapter applies the same two-pass approach with `phase = 2` substituted throughout, and does not duplicate the methodology text.

#### Phase-entry definition

Entry ply comes from `game_positions.phase` (SmallInteger, `0=opening / 1=middlegame / 2=endgame`; see `app/models/game_position.py:90-94`). The endgame-entry definition used in 3.1.2 is consistent with 3.2.1 / 3.3.1 / 3.4.1's `endgame_class IS NOT NULL` thanks to **PHASE-INV-01** (`phase=2 ⟺ endgame_class IS NOT NULL`). Future edits to either definition must preserve this invariant — if PHASE-INV-01 is ever broken, 3.1.2's endgame metric and the 3.2.1/3.3.1/3.4.1 metrics will silently drift apart.

#### Symmetric baseline — the calibration target

The baseline encodes Stockfish's structural first-move tempo for white at the entry ply. We use a **symmetric** baseline by construction: `EVAL_BASELINE_CP_WHITE = +X`, `EVAL_BASELINE_CP_BLACK = −X`, computed from a **single deduplicated game-level mean** (one row per `(platform, platform_game_id)`, white-POV).

Why dedupe: the benchmark sample stores one row per (benchmark user, game). The white-user and black-user slices are made up of almost entirely *different* physical games (typically <1% overlap), so the per-color slice means absorb the small skill edge of benchmark users vs their typical opponent and split asymmetrically (e.g. +31.5 / −18.9 in 2026-05 Lichess). Deduping to physical games cancels that skill edge and yields a single number (~+25 cp for current data). The symmetric baseline is then `+X / −X`, which:

- Folds the engine-tempo asymmetry into the baseline cleanly.
- Leaves the centered per-(user, color) distributions the **same shape** in both colors, offset by at most the benchmark skill edge (~±6 cp), which is small relative to the per-user-mean SD (~75 cp) and irrelevant to bullet-chart zone widths.
- Eliminates the need for a per-color sub-block, color-axis Cohen's d, or per-color skew/kurtosis — all degenerate under symmetry.

**Methodology change history:**
- 2026-05-04 v3 (this version): symmetric baseline from deduped game-level mean. Color-split sub-block, color-axis Cohen's d, and per-color skew/kurtosis dropped — degenerate by construction. Both color slices pool into a single calibration distribution.
- 2026-05-04 v2 (rejected): per-color asymmetric baselines (+31.5 / −18.9) computed from per-user-color slices. Rejected — the asymmetry was a sampling artefact of the single-row-per-benchmark-user data shape, not a real population effect. Per-color baselines were harder to explain and didn't improve calibration.
- 2026-05-04 v1 (rejected): per-user mean pooled across colors. Rejected — conflated color-mix variance with within-color spread.
- Pre-2026-05-04 (rejected): per-user median. Rejected for definitional consistency with the live z-test (`mean = eval_sum / n`).

#### Sign convention

User-POV: `signed_cp = CASE WHEN user_color='white' THEN eval_cp ELSE -eval_cp END`. Positive values mean the user is winning at the entry ply. Centered: `delta = signed_cp − (CASE WHEN user_color='white' THEN +X ELSE -X END)`.

#### Mate handling and outlier trim — match production exactly

The production aggregator (`app/repositories/stats_repository.py:556-560`, `has_continuous_in_domain_eval` predicate) feeds the live z-test only rows where:

- `eval_cp IS NOT NULL`
- `eval_mate IS NULL`           (mate scores excluded entirely — no sentinel)
- `abs(eval_cp) < 2000`          (D-08 outlier trim, `EVAL_OUTLIER_TRIM_CP = 2000`)

2.1 and 3.1.2 must apply the **same three filters** in both passes so per-user means are computed over the same row set the live test consumes. Mate scores are reported separately as a footnote count, but never folded into the mean (no sentinel). NULL-eval rows are dropped (not routed to 0). Outlier rows (`|eval_cp| >= 2000`) are dropped (not clipped).

#### Sample floor

≥ 20 games per user with a continuous in-domain eval at the entry ply (matches `EVAL_CONFIDENCE_MIN_N = 20` in `opening_insights_constants.py` — same gate the live z-test uses). Two notes on the MG vs EG asymmetry:
- **Middlegame entry retains ≈ all qualifying games** — almost every rated game reaches `phase = 1`.
- **Endgame entry (3.1.2) retains the games that reach `phase = 2`** — closer to the endgame-reaching subset, but *without* the `≥ 6 endgame plies` requirement (the metric only needs the entry ply itself to exist). Per-cell sample sizes for the endgame metric will therefore be slightly looser than the endgame-reaching metrics.

#### Eval coverage sanity check

Reuse the Chapter-1 "Eval coverage check" CTE pattern, parameterized over phase: substitute `WHERE phase = 1` (and drop the `HAVING count(*) >= 6`) for middlegame entry, `WHERE phase = 2` for endgame entry. Lichess analyzed games typically have eval from move 1, but partial-analysis games can be sparser at early plies — flag in the report header if **middlegame-entry coverage is materially below endgame-entry coverage** (e.g. >2 pp gap). NULL-eval and mate-eval entry plies are excluded from the per-user mean (matching production), so a coverage drop biases the mean toward whichever subset of games happens to have continuous in-domain eval. Report mate-row prevalence as a footnote.

#### Query

The query runs in **two passes**:
1. **Symmetric baseline pass (deduped, game-level)** — produces `BASELINE_CP` (one number, white-POV). Inlined into pass 2. NO equal-footing filter — calibrate against the production-realistic regime, matching what the live z-test consumes.
2. **Centered per-(user, color) pooled distribution** — the calibration target.

```sql
-- Pass 1: symmetric engine baseline at MG entry, deduped per physical game.
-- NO equal-footing filter.
WITH first_phase AS (
  SELECT game_id, MIN(ply) AS entry_ply
  FROM game_positions

  JOIN first_phase fp ON fp.game_id = g.id

  WHERE g.rated AND NOT g.is_computer_game

```

For 2026-05 Lichess at MG entry the deduped baseline was **+25 cp** (n=1.25M; median +24; SD 238). Black baseline = −25 cp by construction.

**TC and ELO collapse verdicts on centered data.** `GROUP BY tc` (resp. `elo_bucket`) over `mid_centered`, then apply Cohen's d (max group mean minus min group mean, divided by sqrt(avg of group variances)). Centering is constant within a color so within-color spread is unchanged; report once for the headline summary.

#### Output

1. **Symmetric baseline table** — single row from pass 1: `n_games / baseline_cp_white / median / SD` (white-POV, deduped).
2. **Centered pooled distribution table** — single row from pass 2: `n / mean / p05 / p25 / p50 / p75 / p95 / SD`.
3. **Collapse verdict block** — TC (d_max on centered) and ELO (d_max on centered). Color collapse is automatic by construction; do not report.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - **Baseline constant**: compare pass-1 `baseline_cp_white` to live `EVAL_BASELINE_CP_WHITE` (in `app/services/opening_insights_constants.py`). Recommend update when |measured − constant| > 5 cp; round to whole cp. `EVAL_BASELINE_CP_BLACK` should always equal `-EVAL_BASELINE_CP_WHITE` — flag if violated.
   - **Neutral-zone bounds**: pooled centered `[p25, p75]`, rounded to **symmetric ±X cp** (use the larger of |p25|, |p75| rounded to nearest 5 cp). Asymmetric bounds only if `|ctr_mean| > 10 cp` (means the benchmark skill edge is large enough to bias zones).
   - **Domain bounds**: pooled centered `[p05, p95]`, rounded to symmetric ±X cp. Stretch to cover the 800-cohort tail if the bullet chart serves all ELOs.
   - **Comparison vs live constants**: grep against `EVAL_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX_PAWNS` and `EVAL_BULLET_DOMAIN_PAWNS` in `frontend/src/lib/openingStatsZones.ts`. Recommend update when |measured − constant| > 5 cp.
   - **Mate-row footnote**: count of mate rows excluded by the `eval_mate IS NULL` filter (total across the deduped sample).

## 3. Endgames

Calibrations that feed the Endgames → Stats page. Subchapters match the four H2 sections on that page, in display order: **3.1 Endgame Overall Performance** → **3.2 Endgame Metrics and ELO** → **3.3 Time Pressure** → **3.4 Endgame Type Breakdown**.

### 3.1 Endgame Overall Performance

Maps to the page H2 of the same name. Subsections in the order the gauges/tiles appear on the page: Card 1 ("Games without Endgame") → Card 2 ("Eval at Endgame Entry": entry eval + Achievable Score) → Card 3 ("Games with Endgame") → "Endgame Score Differences" row.

#### 3.1.1 Non-Endgame Score (per-user)

**Question:** How does the per-user **absolute** non-endgame score (`(W + 0.5·D) / total` over games that do NOT reach the 6-ply endgame floor) distribute across the population? This calibrates Card 1 ("Games without Endgame") of the Endgame Overall Performance section, which renders a score bullet using the shared `SCORE_BULLET_*` config.

**No new query.** The 3.1.6 Endgame Score Gap query already computes `per_user.non_eg_score` for every selected user. Re-aggregate that column without re-running the SQL:

```sql
-- Reuse 3.1.6's per_user CTE and aggregate non_eg_score directly.
SELECT
  count(*) AS n_users,
  round(avg(non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_mean,
  round(stddev_samp(non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_sd,
  round(percentile_cont(0.05) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_p05,
  round(percentile_cont(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_p25,
  round(percentile_cont(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_p50,
  round(percentile_cont(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_p75,
  round(percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY non_eg_score)::numeric, 4) AS non_eg_p95
FROM per_user
WHERE NOT (elo_bucket = 2400 AND tc = 'classical');
```

**Sample floor:** inherits 3.1.6's `≥30 endgame AND ≥30 non-endgame games per user` filter.

**Recommendations:**

- **Cohort neutral band** = pooled `[non_eg_p25, non_eg_p75]`, rounded to 2 decimal places. Compare to `[SCORE_BULLET_CENTER + SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN, SCORE_BULLET_CENTER + SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MAX] = [0.45, 0.55]`.
- **Recommendation routing**: `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_*` is shared with the Openings score bullet. If the non-EG `[p25, p75]` materially differs from the shared band, the right move is a dedicated non-EG zones module (mirroring the relationship between `endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` and `openingStatsZones.ts`), not retuning the shared constant.
- **Collapse verdict**: TC d_max + ELO d_max from per-user `non_eg_score` distribution (same Cohen's d recipe as every other subchapter).

#### 3.1.2 Endgame-entry eval (pawns)

**Question:** At the first ply of the endgame (`phase = 2`), how does the per-(user, color) Stockfish eval distribute across the population? Calibrates Card 2 row 1 ("Endgame Entry Eval") of the Endgame Overall Performance section, which renders a 0-centered pawn-unit bullet via `frontend/src/lib/endgameEntryEvalZones.ts`.

**Methodology — reference 2.1.** This subchapter applies the same two-pass symmetric-baseline approach defined in 2.1 (Phase-entry definition, Symmetric baseline rationale, Sign convention, Mate handling and outlier trim, Sample floor, Eval coverage sanity check). The only differences are:

- `WHERE phase = 2` (replaces `WHERE phase = 1`) in both passes.
- The MG baseline `25.0` is replaced by the EG baseline produced by pass 1 of this subchapter.
- **EG-entry tile is 0-centered in the live UI** (`ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_CENTER = 0`, no baseline subtraction). The pass-1 EG baseline is computed and reported for context, but the live tile renders the **uncentered** user-POV eval — so the calibration recommendations for `endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` come from the **uncentered** per-(user, color) distribution, not the centered one. The centered distribution is still reported (for Cohen's d and methodological parity with 2.1), but the neutral-zone / domain recommendations read off the uncentered percentiles.

**TC and ELO collapse verdicts on centered data.** `GROUP BY tc` (resp. `elo_bucket`) over `eg_centered`, then apply Cohen's d per the Chapter-1 recipe.

#### Output

1. **Symmetric baseline table** — single row from pass 1: `n_games / baseline_cp_white / median / SD` (white-POV, deduped).
2. **Distribution table** — two rows from pass 2: uncentered + centered, with `n / mean / p05 / p25 / p50 / p75 / p95 / SD`.
3. **Collapse verdict block** — TC + ELO d_max on centered. Color collapse is automatic by construction.
4. **Recommendations** (feed `frontend/src/lib/endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` from the **uncentered** distribution, in pawn units = cp / 100):
   - **Neutral-zone bounds**: `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX_PAWNS` = uncentered `[p25, p75]` converted to pawns, rounded sensibly. **Editorial tightening (memory `feedback_zone_band_judgement.md`)**: if pooled IQR is wide enough that meaningful effects would land in `typical`, tighten inside IQR so the tile actually paints red/green (e.g. the pawn-unit IQR of ±0.75 was tightened to ±0.50 in a prior pass).
   - **Domain bounds**: `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_DOMAIN_PAWNS` = uncentered `[p05, p95]` converted to pawns.
   - **Center**: `ENDGAME_ENTRY_EVAL_CENTER = 0` (tile is 0-centered by construction; do not change without a UI argument).
   - **Mate-row footnote**: count of mate rows excluded.

#### 3.1.3 Achievable Score (Stockfish-predicted expected score at EG entry)

**Question:** At endgame entry, what score does Stockfish predict for this player given the position they walked into? Per-user `entry_xs = avg(expected_score)` over endgame-reaching games in the user's selected TC, where `expected_score ∈ [0, 1]` is computed from the entry-ply Stockfish eval via the Lichess winning-chances sigmoid (cp) or direct 0/1 mapping (mate). Calibrates Card 2 row 2 ("Achievable Score") of the Endgame Overall Performance section.

**Why a separate subchapter from 3.1.4:** 3.1.4 measures the **final** EG-only score (where the user actually finishes after playing the endgame). 3.1.3 measures the **predicted-from-position** score at endgame entry (what an engine would expect from the position, before the user touches it). The gap between 3.1.3's pooled cohort band and the user's `entry_xs` answers "did the user walk into a worse-than-cohort position?" — separate from the "what did they do with it?" signal in 3.1.4. Both are needed for the Endgame Start vs End twin-tile section (Phase 81/83).

**Per-user metric:**
- `expected_score` per game = Lichess winning-chances sigmoid applied to `eval_cp × color_sign` (mate forces 0 or 1), at the first endgame-class ply.
- `entry_xs` = mean per game in the user's selected TC, restricted to endgame-reaching games (`game_id` in `endgame_game_ids`).
- Same `≥6 plies with endgame_class IS NOT NULL` gate as 3.1.4 / 3.1.5 / 3.2.1 / 3.3.1 / 3.4.1. The metric is uncentered (no baseline subtract); cohort band is direct.

**Sample floor:** ≥20 endgame-entry games per user per cell (matches 3.1.4's per-user floor).

The cohort band is a **dedicated EG-entry score band** — not shared with `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_*` (which drives the Openings per-position score bullet on a different population) or with `endgame_score` (which drives the 3.1.4 final-score zone). All three populations differ; do not retune one band based on another's data.

The full 5×4 cell table re-runs the same shape for the sparse `(2400, classical)` cell with an `n=2*` footnote (12 completed users overall, most below the 20-game floor). TC marginal, ELO marginal, and pooled overall come from re-aggregating `per_user_excl_sparse` over `tc` only / `elo_bucket` only / no group. `xs_mean` / `xs_var` columns feed Cohen's d per the canonical "Computing Cohen's d in SQL" recipe.

##### Output

1. **5×4 cell table** of per-user `entry_xs` (`p25 / p50 / p75 (n_users)`), sparse cell footnoted.
2. **TC marginal** (4 rows pooled across ELO): `n_users / mean / p25 / p50 / p75`.
3. **ELO marginal** (5 rows pooled across TC): same columns.
4. **Pooled overall**: 1 row — feeds the cohort-band recommendation.
5. **Recommendations:**
   - **Sanity check on equal-footing filter (game-time bucketing aware)**: under rating-at-game-time bucketing the 800–1600 game-time buckets should sit within ≈±1.5 pp of 0.50 (the chess-fairness null) with **no monotone rise** across them — that is the test the equal-footing filter must pass. Do **not** expect 2000/2400 to land at 0.50: a monotone-rising residual there (≈+2–3 pp) is the **known, documented out-of-scope confound** (rating-lag tail + `select_benchmark_users.py` D-01 no-cheat-filtering), not a filter failure. Treat a 2000/2400 residual as expected and footnote it; do **not** "fix" it by relaxing the equal-footing window or re-collecting. Only flag if 800–1600 themselves drift above ≈0.515 or show a monotone ramp (that would indicate the filter or game-time bucketing is misapplied). See "Rating-lag selection bias (game-time bucketing)" in chapter 1.
   - **Cohort neutral band** = pooled `[xs_p25, xs_p75]`, rounded to 2 decimal places. Asymmetric is OK (the cohort skill edge sits ~+1 pp above 50%).
   - **Editorial tightening (D-15, memory `feedback_zone_band_judgement.md`)**: if pooled IQR is wide enough that meaningful effects would land in `typical`, tighten inside IQR so the tile actually paints red/green. For this metric pooled IQR is already ~9 pp wide — usually no further tightening is needed (unlike `entry_eval_pawns` where the pawn-unit IQR of ±0.75 was tightened to ±0.50).
   - **Recommendation routing**: this calibration goes into a new EG-entry score-zone entry in the Python `ZONE_REGISTRY` and a regenerated `endgameZones.ts` (do **not** retune `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_*` or the 3.1.4 `endgame_score` band — different populations).
6. **Collapse verdict block**: TC d_max + ELO d_max from per-user `entry_xs` distribution, plus a 5×4 heatmap of `xs_p50`. Per the canonical thresholds (< 0.2 collapse / 0.2–0.5 review / ≥ 0.5 keep separate).

#### 3.1.4 Endgame Score (per-user, EG-only)

**Question:** How does the per-user **absolute** endgame score (`(W + 0.5·D) / total` over endgame-reaching games) distribute across the population, and does it shift across (TC × ELO) cells? This calibrates Card 3 ("Games with Endgame") of the Endgame Overall Performance section, and confirms whether the score bullet's static 0.45–0.55 / 0.25–0.75 axis remains population-honest at the EG-only subset.

**Why a separate subchapter from 3.1.6:** 3.1.6 measures the **differential** `eg_score − non_eg_score` (does the user lose ground in endgames?). 3.1.4 measures the **absolute** EG-only score (where do they actually finish?). The live UI tile reads the absolute number against a fixed 50% null; 3.1.4's pooled distribution and per-cell spread tell us whether a cohort-band overlay is needed (per-ELO or pooled) and where its `[p25, p75]` bounds sit.

**Per-user metric:**
- `eg_score = (W + 0.5·D) / total` over the user's endgame-reaching games in their selected TC.
- "Endgame-reaching" = `game_id` in `endgame_game_ids` (the shared `≥6 plies with endgame_class IS NOT NULL` building block — same gate 3.1.5 / 3.1.6 / 3.2.1 / 3.3.1 / 3.4.1 use). The metric is the simple per-user score; it is **not** centered on any baseline (the live tile's null is a fixed 50%).

**Sample floor:** ≥20 endgame games per user per cell (matches 3.2.1's per-user floor; tighter than 3.1.6's ≥30 because there is no non-endgame slice to also pass a floor on).

##### Currently set in code

| Constant | Live value | File |
|---|---:|---|
| `SCORE_BULLET_CENTER` | `0.5` | `frontend/src/lib/scoreBulletConfig.ts` |
| `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN` | `-0.05` | same |
| `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MAX` | `+0.05` | same |
| `SCORE_BULLET_DOMAIN` | `0.25` (half-width — axis 0.25–0.75) | same |

The score-bullet config is **shared** with the Openings score bullet (per-position WDL on the Moves tab). 3.1.4 calibrates the EG-only subset specifically — if the pooled EG `[p25, p75]` differs materially from the existing ±0.05 band, the right call is usually a dedicated EG-only zones module (mirroring `endgameEntryEvalZones.ts` vs `openingStatsZones.ts`), not retuning the shared constant.

A monotone 2000/2400 residual (≈+2–3 pp) is the **known out-of-scope confound** (rating-lag tail + D-01 no-cheat-filtering), expected and footnoted, **not** a filter failure and **not** to be fixed by relaxing the equal-footing window. Do not apply the old blanket `|pooled mean − 0.50| > 0.01` test across all buckets — it false-positives at 2000/2400 by design. See "Rating-lag selection bias (game-time bucketing)" in chapter 1.
   - **Cohort domain bounds** = pooled `[eg_p05, eg_p95]`. Compare to `[0.25, 0.75]` (current bullet axis).
   - **Per-ELO stratification check**: if ELO-marginal `eg_p50` spread (max − min) exceeds the pooled IQR width, recommend a per-ELO `ENDGAME_SCORE_ZONES` registry (mirroring `ENDGAME_SKILL_ZONES`) — see SEED-013 Plan 3.
   - **Recommendation routing**: if collapse verdict says "single global zone", calibration goes into a new EG-only score-zone module (do **not** retune the shared `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_*` — that constant also drives the Openings score bullet, where the population is different).
6. **Collapse verdict block**: TC d_max + ELO d_max from per-user `eg_score` distribution, plus a 5×4 heatmap of `eg_p50`. Per the canonical thresholds (< 0.2 collapse / 0.2–0.5 review / ≥ 0.5 keep separate).

#### 3.1.5 Achievable Score Gap

**Question:** How does per-user `achievable_score_gap = mean(actual_score_i − expected_score_i)` (the **paired per-game** gap between what the user achieved and what Stockfish predicted at endgame entry) distribute across the population, and does it shift across (TC × ELO) cells? Calibrates the "Achievable Score Gap" gauge in the "Endgame Score Differences" row of the Endgame Overall Performance section.

**Why a separate subchapter from 3.1.3 and 3.1.6:** 3.1.3 measures the **predicted** score at entry (`entry_xs = avg(expected_score)`). 3.1.4 measures the **achieved** score in endgames (`eg_score`). 3.1.5 (this subchapter) measures their **paired per-game difference** — the gauge in the UI reports a single per-user number, not a difference of two pooled means, so the per-game variance matters for the CI computation. (Mathematically `mean(actual − expected) ≡ mean(actual) − mean(expected)` over the same game set, but the live `compute_paired_difference_test` consumes the per-game `d_i` array directly for its SE; calibrating from `d_i` keeps the benchmark variance comparable to the live CI.) 3.1.6 measures a different population-level gap: `eg_score − non_eg_score` (endgame vs non-endgame games), which has nothing to do with the engine prediction.

**Live-UI provenance:** mirrors `compute_endgame_performance` in `app/services/endgame_service.py:1820–1880` (Phase 85.1 paired-diff accumulator, SEC1-10). The filter for the per-game pair is: `eval_mate IS NOT NULL` (mate INCLUDED, mapped to 0/1 via `eval_mate_to_expected_score`) OR (`eval_cp IS NOT NULL` AND `|eval_cp| < EVAL_CLIP_MAX_CP = 2000`). Both-NULL games are dropped. `actual_score_i ∈ {0.0, 0.5, 1.0}` via `derive_user_result`.

**Per-user metric:**
- `expected_score_i` per game = Lichess winning-chances sigmoid on user-POV `eval_cp` (mate forces 0/1 in user-POV), at the first endgame-class ply. Same definition as 3.1.3, but with **mate INCLUDED** and `|eval_cp| >= 2000` *clipped* (i.e. those games are excluded from both accumulators identically — see live code).
- `actual_score_i` per game = 1.0 / 0.5 / 0.0 from `g.result × g.user_color`.
- `d_i = actual_score_i − expected_score_i`.
- `achievable_score_gap = mean(d_i)` per user, over their endgame-reaching games in the selected TC.

**Sample floor:** ≥20 paired games per user per cell (matches the live `PVALUE_RELIABILITY_MIN_N = 10` for p-value gating, but doubled here to align with 3.1.3 / 3.1.4 cohort-band floors).

The full 5×4 cell table re-runs the same shape for the sparse `(2400, classical)` cell with an `n=N*` footnote. TC marginal, ELO marginal, and pooled overall come from re-aggregating `per_user_excl_sparse` over `tc` only / `elo_bucket` only / no group. `gap_mean` / `gap_var` columns feed Cohen's d per the canonical "Computing Cohen's d in SQL" recipe.

##### Output

1. **5×4 cell table** of per-user `achievable_gap` (`gap_p25 / gap_p50 / gap_p75 (n_users)`), all rendered as **pp** (multiply by 100, one decimal, suffix `pp`). Sparse cell footnoted.
2. **TC marginal** (4 rows pooled across ELO): `n_users / gap_mean / gap_sd / gap_p25 / gap_p50 / gap_p75` — all gap columns in pp.
3. **ELO marginal** (5 rows pooled across TC): same columns.
4. **Pooled overall**: 1 row — feeds the cohort-band recommendation.
5. **Recommendations:**
   - **Sanity check on engine alignment**: pooled mean should sit within `±1pp` of 0 (the engine-alignment null). A persistent positive gap means the cohort systematically outperforms the engine prediction at endgame entry, which would point to a model-calibration bug rather than a population effect.
   - **Cohort neutral band** = pooled `[gap_p25, gap_p75]` rendered in pp, rounded to whole pp. Symmetric `±Npp` only if `|pooled mean| < 1pp`; otherwise asymmetric (the engine-alignment null is at 0, not at the population median).
   - **Cohort domain bounds** = pooled `[gap_p05, gap_p95]` in pp, rounded to whole pp.
   - **Editorial tightening (memory `feedback_zone_band_judgement.md`)**: if pooled IQR is wide enough that meaningful effects would land in `typical`, tighten inside IQR so the tile actually paints red/green.
   - **Recommendation routing**: live constants for this gauge are in `EndgamePerformanceSection.tsx` (or a generated module if Phase 85.1 moved them). Do **not** retune the 3.1.6 `SCORE_GAP_*` constants — that gauge measures a different gap.
6. **Collapse verdict block**: TC d_max + ELO d_max from per-user `achievable_gap` distribution, plus a 5×4 heatmap of `gap_p50` (rendered as pp). Per the canonical thresholds (< 0.2 collapse / 0.2–0.5 review / ≥ 0.5 keep separate).

#### 3.1.6 Endgame Score Gap and Timeline

**Question:** How does per-user `eg_score − non_eg_score` distribute across the population, and does the distribution shift across (TC × ELO) cells? Calibrates the "Endgame Score Gap" gauge in the "Endgame Score Differences" row of the Endgame Overall Performance section, plus the eg/non-eg timeline overlay.

**Per-user metrics:**
- `eg_score` = avg score in endgame games (within selected TC)
- `non_eg_score` = avg score in non-endgame games (within selected TC)
- `diff` = eg_score − non_eg_score

   - **Score-gap gauge half-width** = pooled `max(|diff_p05|, |diff_p95|)` in pp. Compare to `SCORE_GAP_DOMAIN`.
   - **Timeline neutral zone** = intersection of pooled `[eg_p25, eg_p75]` and `[non_eg_p25, non_eg_p75]` (timeline Y-axis renders as percent). If overlap ≥ 50% of narrower interval, propose `[max(p25s), min(p75s)]` as a single unified band.

### 3.2 Endgame Metrics and ELO

Maps to the page H2 of the same name. Hosts the `EndgameScoreGapSection` (Conv/Par/Recov gauges + Endgame Skill) and `EndgameEloTimelineSection`.

**ELO timeline note**: no current SKILL calibration. The ELO timeline visualizes per-user rating progression in endgame games — out of scope until a UI argument warrants a population-level overlay.

#### 3.2.1 Conversion / Parity / Recovery + Endgame Skill

**Question:** How do per-user Conversion/Parity/Recovery rates and composite Endgame Skill distribute across cells? Does each metric collapse across TC and/or ELO?

##### Eval-bucket rule (REFAC-02 — mirrors `_classify_endgame_bucket`)

Per-game classification uses the Stockfish eval at the **first endgame ply** of the game. The old `material_imbalance + 4-ply persistence` proxy is gone — REFAC-02 replaced it with a single-point engine eval. With ~100% engine-eval coverage at endgame entry on the benchmark DB, NULL eval should be a rounding error; any remaining NULLs route to `parity`.

- `user_eval = sign * eval_cp` where `sign = +1` for white, `−1` for black.
- If `eval_mate IS NOT NULL`: treat as ±∞ in the user's perspective (positive `user_eval = sign * eval_mate > 0` ⇒ user has the mate ⇒ conversion; negative ⇒ recovery).
- Else if `eval_cp IS NOT NULL`: bucket on `user_eval` vs `EVAL_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD = 100` cp.
  - `conversion` if `user_eval >=  100`
  - `recovery`   if `user_eval <= -100`
  - `parity`     otherwise
- Else (both NULL): `parity`.

The mate-score handling matches `_classify_endgame_bucket` exactly — mate scores skip the cp threshold and force conversion/recovery.

##### Per-bucket rate definitions (mirror `_endgame_skill_from_bucket_rows`)
- conversion → `1.0` if user won else `0.0` (Win %)
- parity → user score `1.0 / 0.5 / 0.0` (Score %)
- recovery → `1.0` if user won or drew else `0.0` (Save %)

##### Population bucket prevalence (reference, 2026-05-03)

How endgame-entry games partition into the three buckets across the benchmark DB (selected users, `status='completed'`, sparse `(2400, classical)` cell excluded). Useful as a sanity check for bucketing changes — if a refactor of the eval rule moves these numbers more than ~1pp it warrants investigation.

Cell = `n (%) [avg user_eval_cp]`. The eval is `sign * eval_cp` (user-perspective), averaged across games where `eval_cp IS NOT NULL` (mate scores excluded from the average).

| Filter | n_games | conversion | parity | recovery | overall avg eval |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Base only (`rated AND NOT is_computer_game`) | 708,032 | 274,391 (38.75%) [+430 cp] | 177,987 (25.14%) [+1 cp] | 255,654 (36.11%) [−429 cp] | +12 cp |
| Base + equal-footing (`abs(opp_rating − user_rating) ≤ 100`) | 554,608 | 211,443 (38.12%) [+430 cp] | 137,133 (24.73%) [+1 cp] | 206,032 (37.15%) [−430 cp] | +4 cp |

The equal-footing filter retains ~78% of games and shrinks the conversion–recovery gap from +2.7pp to +1.0pp, consistent with higher-rated cohorts padding their conversion rate via softer matchmaking. The overall user-perspective eval also shrinks from +12 cp to +4 cp, confirming the same matchmaking confound at the eval level. Per-bucket eval magnitudes (~±430 cp) are nearly identical across filter regimes — the equal-footing filter changes which games qualify, not the within-bucket eval distribution. Buckets are roughly balanced (≈38 / 25 / 37), so eval-coverage regressions to NULL would noticeably swell the parity bucket and shift its avg-eval column toward the games-without-eval cohort's true distribution.

##### Eval distribution at endgame entry (reference, 2026-05-03)

Shape of the per-game user-perspective eval (`sign * eval_cp`) at first endgame ply, equal-footing filter applied, mate scores and NULL eval excluded. Useful when evaluating whether to surface "avg eval at endgame entry" as a user-facing metric — the per-game noise is the relevant constraint for any per-user mean displayed in the live UI.

**Summary** (n = 541,642): mean = **+4.0 cp**, **SD = 417.9 cp**, median = 0, IQR `[−300, +312]`, p05/p95 `[−681, +684]`.

**Histogram (100 cp bins, % of games):**

| bin (cp) | pct | bin (cp) | pct |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ≤ −1000 | 0.45 | +0…+100 | **13.76** |
| −1000…−900 | 0.55 | +100…+200 | 6.44 |
| −900…−800 | 1.18 | +200…+300 | 5.72 |
| −800…−700 | 2.28 | +300…+400 | 5.71 |
| −700…−600 | 3.18 | +400…+500 | 7.08 |
| −600…−500 | 4.97 | +500…+600 | 5.07 |
| −500…−400 | 6.87 | +600…+700 | 3.26 |
| −400…−300 | 5.50 | +700…+800 | 2.29 |
| −300…−200 | 5.53 | +800…+900 | 1.22 |
| −200…−100 | 6.29 | +900…+1000 | 0.56 |
| −100…0 | **11.62** | ≥ +1000 | 0.48 |

**Shape:** strong central peak (~25% of games within ±100 cp), gentle dip in ±200–300, mild secondary shoulders around ±400–500 ("piece hung in the middlegame" cohort), symmetric tails decaying out past ±1000. **Trimodal-ish, not bimodal** — the central peak dominates by a wide margin. Conv-vs-recov bucket counts (38/25/37) are not a faithful split of the eval distribution: most parity-bucket games sit in the central spike, but conversion/recovery buckets have substantial mass at moderate evals (±150-300) on top of the heavy ±400-500 shoulder.

**Sample-size implications for per-user mean significance** (test against 0, α=0.05, 80% power, with σ ≈ 418 cp ⇒ n ≈ 16·σ²/Δ²):

| effect Δ (cp) | n endgame games |
|---:|---:|
| +50 | ~1,100 |
| +100 | ~280 |
| +200 | ~70 |

So a per-user sig test against 0 reliably catches users systematically entering at ≳+150 cp ("you outplay opponents into endgames") on a few-hundred-game corpus, and will say "no signal" for genuine +50 to +100 cp users. UI copy should phrase the null as "we can't tell" rather than "no advantage."

##### Eval × clock-diff cross-user correlation (reference, 2026-05-03)

Cross-user Pearson correlation between **per-user mean eval at endgame entry** (cp) and **per-user mean clock-diff %** (`(user_clk - opp_clk) / base_time_seconds * 100`). Filter floor: ≥30 endgame games/user/TC, mate scores excluded, equal-footing applied. Computed to test whether the proposed user-facing narrative *"you enter endgames at +X cp but pay for it with Y% less time"* is supported by population-level co-movement.

| TC | n users | Pearson r | avg user_mean_eval (cp) | avg user_mean_clock_diff (%) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| bullet | 494 | **−0.43** | −2 | −0.16 |
| blitz | 494 | **−0.33** | +14 | −1.38 |
| rapid | 482 | −0.00 | +22 | −1.47 |
| classical | 212 | +0.06 | +7 | −4.52 |
| pooled | 1,682 | −0.13 | +11 | −1.44 |

**Interpretation:** the trade-off is real in **bullet/blitz** — users who systematically enter endgames at higher eval do systematically have lower relative clock. r ≈ −0.4 is moderate but unambiguous. In **rapid/classical** the correlation collapses to zero — time isn't the binding constraint, so eval differences and clock differences come from independent sources (skill vs move-pace habits). The pooled r = −0.13 is dominated by the bullet/blitz signal.

**Design implication:** a global "you paid for it with time" framing in the live UI would tell a false causal story to roughly half of users (everyone on rapid/classical). Three honest options: (a) show the two numbers as independent facts, (b) compute per-user across-game r and gate the trade-off framing on it, (c) TC-gate the framing (bullet/blitz only). Note that this is **cross-user** correlation; the within-user across-games version is what actually backs a user's own dashboard claim, but the cross-user zero in slow TCs strongly suggests the within-user effect is unlikely to be robust there either.

**Per-user-mean averaging caveat:** the user-weighted mean eval (+11 cp pooled) sits higher than the game-weighted population mean (+4 cp from the prevalence table) because each user counts equally regardless of game count. Both numbers are "right" — pick the unit that matches the framing.

##### Endgame Skill
Unweighted mean of the non-empty per-bucket rates. A user with all three buckets has `skill = (conv + par + recov) / 3`; one with only parity has `skill = parity_rate`. Sample floor: ≥20 endgame games per user per cell + ≥2 of 3 buckets non-empty (defensive — with eval coverage near 100% essentially every user has all three).

##### Output (one block per metric: Conversion, Parity, Recovery, Endgame Skill)

1. **5×4 cell table** of per-user p50 (`p50 (n_users)`).
2. **TC marginal** + **ELO marginal** percentile tables.
3. **Pooled overall** — feeds the gauge neutral-zone recommendation.
4. **Recommendations** per metric:
   - `Conversion` neutral band = pooled `[conv_p25, conv_p75]` rounded. Compare to `FIXED_GAUGE_ZONES.conversion` (`[0.65, 0.75]`).
   - `Parity` neutral band = same. Compare to `[0.45, 0.55]`.
   - `Recovery` neutral band = same. Compare to `[0.25, 0.35]`.
   - `Endgame Skill` neutral band = pooled `[skill_p25, skill_p75]`. Compare to `ENDGAME_SKILL_ZONES`.
   - For each, if the cell-level p50 spread across cells exceeds `2 × (band width)`, the pooled band cannot center every cell — flag in the verdict.
5. **Collapse verdict block** per metric.

#### 3.2.2 Per-bucket ΔES Score Gap (Section 2 — Phase 87.2)

**Question:** How does the per-span ΔES Score Gap, partitioned by the **eval-entry bucket** `_classify_endgame_bucket(eval_cp, eval_mate, user_color)` (conversion / parity / recovery), distribute per user per bucket? What is the per-axis (TC × ELO) Cohen's-d collapse verdict per bucket? What bands should land in `ZONE_REGISTRY["section2_score_gap_{conv,parity,recov,skill}"]`?

**User-facing terminology** (per CONTEXT.md D-07):
- Card row labels: **"Conversion Score Gap"** / **"Parity Score Gap"** / **"Recovery Score Gap"** / **"Skill Score Gap"**.
- Glossary umbrella: **"Section 2 Score Gap"** (disambiguates from "Endgame Score Gap", "Achievable Score Gap", and "Endgame Type Score Gap").
- Internal identifiers: `section2_score_gap_{conv,parity,recov,skill}` (snake_case, preserves grep-ability).

**Per-user metric definition (per bucket):**
- One row per qualifying span: `(game_id, endgame_class, span_min_ply)` with ≥ `ENDGAME_PLY_THRESHOLD` (= 6) plies.
- **Bucket assignment:** `_classify_endgame_bucket(eval_cp, eval_mate, user_color)` at the span-entry eval. `eval_cp ≥ +100 cp` (user-perspective) → conversion; `eval_cp ≤ −100 cp` → recovery; else parity. Mate scores force conversion (user-favorable mate) or recovery (user-unfavorable mate). NULL eval → parity (non-issue in practice on the benchmark DB; eval coverage is ~100%).
- **`gap_span`** = `exit_score − ES_entry` per Phase 87.1's `_compute_span_gap` formula (reused verbatim — see §3.4.2 for the full derivation). Sign convention: positive = user outperformed the Stockfish baseline across this span.
- **`per_user_per_bucket_mean`** = `mean(gap_span)` over all qualifying spans in that bucket for that user.
- **Skill aggregate (D-01):** equal-weighted mean of the three bucket means: `Skill_ΔES = (mean_conv + mean_parity + mean_recov) / 3`. Buckets with `n < CONFIDENCE_MIN_N` (= 10) are dropped from the average (denominator → 2 or 1). If all three are below the floor, Skill ΔES is null.

**Sample floor:** ≥ 20 qualifying spans per user per bucket per cell (mirrors the §3.4.2 span floor). For the Skill aggregate, require ≥ 10 spans per active bucket before including it in the equal-weighted mean, matching `CONFIDENCE_MIN_N`.

**Cohen's-d collapse verdict per axis (TC, ELO):**
Apply the same 3-level pattern as §3.4.2: `d < 0.2` collapse, `0.2 ≤ d < 0.5` review, `d ≥ 0.5` keep separate. Compute per bucket (conv, parity, recov, skill) separately — buckets may diverge.

**Sigmoid-bias expectation** (per RESEARCH §/benchmarks Cohen's-d collapse expectation):
- **Conv bucket** likely skews negative: `ES_entry ≈ 0.6`, limited upside (ceiling at 1.0), so mean gap tends below 0.
- **Recov bucket** likely skews positive: `ES_entry ≈ 0.4`, limited downside (floor at 0.0), so mean gap tends above 0.
- **Parity bucket** roughly symmetric: no strong sigmoid asymmetry near 0.5.
- **Skill** (equal-weighted mean) should partially wash out asymmetry.
- If observed verdicts match this prediction, divergent per-bucket bands are the right output — do not force a single global band.

**Decision rule for updating zone bands:**
- If both axes collapse for a bucket: set `ZONE_REGISTRY["section2_score_gap_<bucket>"]` to a single pooled [p25, p75] band.
- If the ELO axis "keeps separate" for a bucket: decide whether to stratify (this phase keeps the scalar MetricId — per-ELO stratification deferred to a follow-on phase).
- Per memory `feedback_zone_band_judgement.md`: tighten the band when small effects are meaningful, even if Cohen's d straddles the collapse threshold.
- Per memory `feedback_llm_significance_signal.md`: do not add a separate sig-test signal to the LLM payload. Tighten the cohort band instead.

**Output instructions:**
1. Update the 4 placeholder ZoneSpec entries in `app/services/endgame_zones.py` with calibrated `(typical_lower, typical_upper)` tuples for each bucket: `ZONE_REGISTRY["section2_score_gap_conv"]`, `ZONE_REGISTRY["section2_score_gap_parity"]`, `ZONE_REGISTRY["section2_score_gap_recov"]`, `ZONE_REGISTRY["section2_score_gap_skill"]`.
2. Run `uv run python scripts/gen_endgame_zones_ts.py` and commit the regenerated `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts` (drift gate enforces parity).
3. Add the per-bucket IQR table and collapse verdict to `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md` under a new §3.2.2 block; archive the previous report per the "Report file layout" rotation rule.

**Note:** Actually running the benchmark query is OUT OF SCOPE for the Phase 87.2 Plan 01 ROADMAP gate — this subchapter documents the method so a future calibration session can produce real bands. Placeholder ±5pp bands from Plan 01 Task 1 remain in effect until then; the codegen drift gate from Plan 01 Task 2 ensures any band update flows through to `endgameZones.ts` automatically.

##### Output

For the §3.2.2 block in `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md`:

1. **Per-bucket per-cell table** (rows = bucket × elo_bucket × tc_bucket): `n_users | mean | sd | p05 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p95`. Sparse cell `(2400, classical)` shown with footnote if present in cell-level grid but excluded from marginals.

2. **Pooled-by-bucket summary row**: `bucket | n_users | pooled_mean | pooled_sd | p25 | p50 | p75`. This is the primary input for the [p25, p75] neutral band recommendation.

3. **Cohen's-d collapse verdict per axis per bucket** (TC and ELO): compute `d_max = max_group_mean - min_group_mean / sqrt(avg group variances)` across the TC (resp. ELO) levels, per bucket. Apply the 3-level threshold. Report the verdict per bucket in a table: `bucket | TC d_max | TC verdict | ELO d_max | ELO verdict`.

4. **Sigmoid-bias check**: compare the sign and magnitude of `pooled_mean` for conv vs recov. Note whether the expected asymmetry (conv negative, recov positive) is confirmed — if it is, divergent per-bucket bands are the right output.

5. **Recommended `ZONE_REGISTRY` updates**: per-bucket [p25, p75] rounded to nearest 1pp; note whether to keep separate per-bucket or collapse to a global band.

6. **Skill aggregate stats**: for each user with ≥ 2 active buckets (n >= 10 per bucket), compute the equal-weighted mean across active buckets and report pooled mean, sd, p25, p50, p75 for the Skill metric.

#### 3.2.3 Rate vs. score-gap divergence (Conversion & Recovery cross-cut)

**Derived — no new query.** This subchapter synthesizes the §3.2.1 raw rates against the §3.2.2 ΔES score gaps for the conversion and recovery buckets. Its job is to surface where the two views of the *same* endgame situation disagree about which axis carries the signal, because that disagreement is what decides whether Section 2's conversion/recovery bullets need a stratified registry.

##### What to compute

Reuse the §3.2.1 per-user `conv_p50` / `recov_p50` cell tables and marginals, and the §3.2.2 per-bucket `mean_gap` cell tables and marginals. For conversion and recovery each, build a 2×2 of `{ELO axis, TC axis} × {raw rate, score gap}` reporting the marginal sweep (min→max level) and the Cohen's `d_max` + verdict already computed upstream. No SQL re-run — pull the numbers from the §3.2.1 and §3.2.2 blocks of the same report.

##### What to report in `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md` under §3.2.3

1. **Axis-driver table** — for Conversion and Recovery, side by side:

   | metric | ELO sweep (raw rate) | ELO d / verdict | TC sweep (raw rate) | TC d / verdict | ELO sweep (score gap) | ELO d / verdict | TC sweep (score gap) | TC d / verdict |

2. **Divergence callout** — explicitly flag any bucket where the raw-rate verdict and the score-gap verdict disagree on the *same axis* (e.g. raw recovery ELO `review` at d≈0.40 vs. recovery-gap ELO `keep separate` at d≈0.85). Explain the mechanism: the raw rate is flat across that axis because the engine-expected score moves *with* the cohort, so the absolute rate masks a relative-skill signal that the gap (which subtracts ES_entry) exposes.

3. **Mirror-axis note** — state when the two buckets move *opposite* directions on an axis (raw recovery falls bullet→classical while raw conversion rises), and that the score gaps for both compress toward their off-zero null as players strengthen and games slow (closer to engine play).

4. **Implication line** — one sentence per divergent bucket: does the gap's stronger axis signal change the §3.2.2 "registry stays scalar" deferral recommendation, or is the scalar pooled band still defensible for this phase. This is advisory only; the binding band recommendation stays in §3.2.2.

##### Snapshot — 2026-05-16 dump (carry forward, refresh each run)

- **Conversion**: raw rate driven by *both* axes same direction (ELO 66.8%→74.9% d=0.82 keep; TC 65.1%→75.6% d=1.02 keep). Score gap also both axes, both compressing toward the −6pp sigmoid null (ELO −14.0pp→−0.3pp d=1.62; TC −13.1pp→−2.0pp d=1.18). **No divergence** — rate and gap agree conversion is a two-axis metric.
- **Recovery**: raw rate is a **TC-only** story (ELO 29.7%→33.0% ~flat d=0.40 review; TC 35.6%→25.0% d=1.10 keep), and runs *opposite* to conversion on TC (more time → less recovery, because the opponent also converts cleanly). The score gap **re-exposes the ELO signal** (ELO +10.7pp→+4.3pp d=0.85 keep; TC +12.8pp→+1.0pp d=1.63 keep). **Divergence on the ELO axis**: weak players over-perform the engine far more when recovering (+10.7pp) than strong players (+4.3pp); the flat raw rate hides this because engine expectation rises with the cohort.
- **Implication**: the recovery-gap ELO `keep separate` (d=0.85) is the strongest argument against §3.2.2's scalar-registry deferral. Recommendation unchanged for this phase (scalar pooled band ships), but flag recovery as the first candidate if/when per-(TC×ELO) stratification of the Section 2 buckets is revisited.

### 3.3 Time Pressure

Maps to the page H2 of the same name. Hosts `EndgameClockPressureSection` + `ClockDiffTimelineChart` + `EndgameTimePressureSection`.

#### 3.3.1 Clock pressure at endgame entry

**Question:** How do per-user clock-diff (% of base time) and net-timeout-rate distribute per cell?

**Primary metric: % of base time.** Live gauge compares `user_avg_pct − opp_avg_pct`, both = `clock_seconds / base_time_seconds * 100`.

##### SQL approximation

The backend scans ply arrays for the first non-NULL clock per parity. SQL approximates by taking clocks at `entry_ply` and `entry_ply + 1` and routing by parity + user_color. This misses NULL-clock plies; small systematic bias vs backend logic.

##### Output

Two metric blocks (% diff, net timeout). Each:
1. **5×4 cell table** of per-user p50.
2. **TC + ELO marginals** with full percentiles.
3. **Recommendations**:
   - `NEUTRAL_PCT_THRESHOLD` = pooled `[pct_p25, pct_p75]` rounded. Compare to live ±10pp.
   - `NEUTRAL_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` = pooled `[net_p25, net_p75]`. Compare to live ±5pp.
   - If TC verdict = `keep`, recommend per-TC thresholds (one value per TC).
4. **Collapse verdict block** per metric.

#### clock-gap-%

**Shape:** per-user mean `(my_clock - opp_clock) / base_clock` at endgame entry, computed per `(user_id, TC, ELO)` cell. Single-dimension metric (no sub-bins). Each user contributes one mean value across their games in the cell. Aggregated across users for the Cohen's d and IQR band computation.

**SQL skeleton:** extend the §3.3.1 standard CTE above. Add a `per_user_gap` CTE that computes per-user mean clock gap per `(user_id, elo_bucket, tc)`, reusing the same `selected_users`, `first_endgame`, `clock_raw`, and `routed` CTEs:

```sql
-- Extend the §3.3.1 query: replace per_user_cell with per_user_gap
per_user_gap AS (
  SELECT
    user_id, elo_bucket, tc,
    count(*) AS games,

  FROM routed
  WHERE user_clk IS NOT NULL AND opp_clk IS NOT NULL
    AND base_time_seconds > 0
    AND user_clk <= 2.0 * base_time_seconds
    AND opp_clk <= 2.0 * base_time_seconds
    -- Equal-footing filter already applied in clock_raw
  GROUP BY user_id, elo_bucket, tc
  HAVING count(*) >= 20
)
SELECT
  elo_bucket, tc,
  count(*) AS n_users,
  round(avg(mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 4) AS gap_mean,
  round(var_samp(mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 6) AS gap_var,
  round(percentile_cont(0.05) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 4) AS gap_p05,
  round(percentile_cont(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 4) AS gap_p25,
  round(percentile_cont(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 4) AS gap_p50,
  round(percentile_cont(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 4) AS gap_p75,
  round(percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean_gap_frac)::numeric, 4) AS gap_p95
FROM per_user_gap
GROUP BY elo_bucket, tc
HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY elo_bucket,
  CASE tc WHEN 'bullet' THEN 1 WHEN 'blitz' THEN 2 WHEN 'rapid' THEN 3 WHEN 'classical' THEN 4 END;
```

Note: the gap fraction here is `(user_clk - opp_clk) / base_clock` (dimensionless, range roughly -1 to +1). Multiply by 100 for percentage display if preferred; the zone constants use the fractional form.

**Expected verdict:** collapse on both TC and ELO axes. The prod-DB distribution (88-RESEARCH.md §Q1) shows skewness approximately -0.05 to -0.09 across TCs (near-symmetric), with IQR approximately ±10–16pp. The modest TC-level difference in mean gap (bullet: -1.3pp, blitz: -4.2pp, rapid: -1.5pp) is unlikely to exceed the d >= 0.2 review threshold once per-user variance is accounted for. ELO is expected to collapse similarly (clock management correlates weakly with rating at a population level).

**Output destination:** `app/services/endgame_zones.py` `ZONE_REGISTRY["clock_gap_pct"]` as a single ZoneSpec with `direction="higher_is_better"`. The zone constants are emitted as flat constants `CLOCK_GAP_NEUTRAL_MIN` / `CLOCK_GAP_NEUTRAL_MAX` in `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts`, following the same pattern as `NEUTRAL_PCT_THRESHOLD`.

**Placeholder note:** the initial scaffolded values are `(-0.05, 0.05)` (matching `NEUTRAL_PCT_THRESHOLD`) and will be replaced with the benchmark-derived IQR band (pooled `[gap_p25, gap_p75]` across all cells) after running this metric on the benchmark DB.

#### 3.3.2 Time pressure vs performance

**Question:** Does the time-pressure-vs-performance curve collapse across (TC × ELO), or does it need stratified display?

The metric is per-time-bucket (10 buckets, 0–100% time-remaining), not a single per-user value, so the verdict is computed slightly differently.

##### Output

1. **Per-bucket curves**: 10-row × 4-column table per ELO bucket (rows = time-bucket 0–9, cols = TCs). Cell = `score (n)`. Suppress n < 100.
2. **TC marginals** (pool ELO): 10-row × 4-col table — the answer to "is TC pooling justified".
3. **ELO marginals** (pool TC): 10-row × 5-col table.
4. **Verdict (per axis)**: per time-bucket, compute marginal-pair Cohen's d on **per-game-score binary outcome** (0/0.5/1) using `n / mean / var_samp`. Take **`max |d|` across buckets where ≥3 marginal levels have n ≥ 100** as the axis verdict input.
5. Recommendation: if either axis verdict ≠ `collapse`, recommend stratified display (per-TC overlay or full per-(TC × ELO) display).
6. **Collapse verdict block**: TC and ELO axes evaluated independently using the per-bucket-pooled approach.

### §3.3.3 chess-score-per-pressure-bin

**Question:** How does per-user chess score distribute across clock-pressure quintiles per (TC, ELO) cell, and can ELO (and TC) be pooled per quintile for a calibrated neutral-zone band?

**Shape:** metric-with-sub-bins. Per-user `user_score = (W + 0.5D) / N` per `(user_id × TC × ELO × quintile)` cell, where `quintile = LEAST(4, FLOOR(user_clk_pct / 20.0)::int)` and `user_clk_pct = user_clock_at_endgame_entry / base_clock * 100`. This is a per-user metric (not game-level aggregate), matching the pattern of §3.1.4 Endgame Score.

**Collapse verdict runs per quintile independently (5 verdicts)**, one per quintile axis pair. Score distributions compress at extreme quintiles (Q0: forced-loss pressure, Q4: full clock), so a global single verdict would obscure quintile-specific stratification needs.

**Shipped band shape:** 20 entries (4 TC × 5 quintile) keyed `(tc, quintile_index)`, values = Q1/Q3 of per-user `user_score` in that cell, ELO pooled by default. Any quintile where the ELO verdict is "keep separate" (d >= 0.5) gets promoted to per-(TC × ELO × quintile) for that quintile only (adds up to 5 entries per stratified quintile).

**Output destination:** `app/services/endgame_zones.py` `PRESSURE_BIN_SCORE_NEUTRAL_ZONES`. Note: `cohort_score` is NOT in this output. It comes from the live API mirror-bucket lookup, not benchmark precomputation.

**Editorial cap:** If `(p75 - p25) / 2 > PRESSURE_BIN_NEUTRAL_CAP` (= 0.06, defined in `endgame_zones.py`), cap the half-width at 0.06 symmetrically around the median. This cap is most likely to activate at extreme quintiles (Q0, Q4) where per-user sample sizes are small.

##### Collapse verdict per quintile

Run the standard Cohen's d recipe (see §"Collapse verdict methodology") independently for each of the 5 quintiles. Each quintile produces two independent verdicts: one for the TC axis and one for the ELO axis. This yields 5 separate verdicts per axis (10 total), not a single global verdict.

For each quintile, pool the cells for the marginal computation:
- **TC marginal:** pool users across ELO buckets per TC level; exclude `NOT (elo_bucket = 2400 AND tc = 'classical')`.
- **ELO marginal:** pool users across TC levels per ELO bucket; same exclusion.

Report as a verdict table:

```
Quintile 0 (0–20% clock remaining — maximum pressure):
  TC axis:  d_max = X.XX (e.g. bullet vs classical) → collapse | review | keep
  ELO axis: d_max = Y.YY (e.g. 800 vs 2400)        → collapse | review | keep

Quintile 1 (20–40% clock remaining):
  TC axis:  d_max = X.XX → collapse | review | keep
  ELO axis: d_max = Y.YY → collapse | review | keep

Quintile 2 (40–60% clock remaining):
  TC axis:  d_max = X.XX → collapse | review | keep
  ELO axis: d_max = Y.YY → collapse | review | keep

Quintile 3 (60–80% clock remaining):
  TC axis:  d_max = X.XX → collapse | review | keep
  ELO axis: d_max = Y.YY → collapse | review | keep

Quintile 4 (80–100% clock remaining — minimum pressure):
  TC axis:  d_max = X.XX → collapse | review | keep
  ELO axis: d_max = Y.YY → collapse | review | keep
```

Thresholds: d < 0.2 = collapse, 0.2–0.5 = review, >= 0.5 = keep separate (identical to §"Collapse verdict methodology"). Each quintile's verdict is independent: Q0 may require TC stratification while Q3 and Q4 collapse cleanly.

Expected outcome from benchmark data (88-RESEARCH.md §Q4): Q0 is where TC matters most (bullet score near 0.26 vs classical near 0.41 under extreme clock pressure). Q4 is expected to collapse more cleanly across TC. ELO is expected to collapse across all quintiles (current pooled d = 0.17 per §3.3.2 data).

##### Output

For each quintile where ELO verdict = "collapse" (expected default): report `(tc, quintile)` IQR band as the shipped zone bound.

1. **5×4 per-quintile verdict table** (quintiles as rows, TC/ELO axes as columns). Format: `d_max → verdict`.
2. **20-entry band table** (4 TC × 5 quintile), ELO pooled. Columns: `tc`, `quintile`, `n_users`, `p25`, `p50`, `p75`, `band_lower` (= p25 or capped), `band_upper` (= p75 or capped).
   - `band_lower = max(p25, p50 - PRESSURE_BIN_NEUTRAL_CAP)` if cap activates.
   - `band_upper = min(p75, p50 + PRESSURE_BIN_NEUTRAL_CAP)` if cap activates.
3. **Recommendations:** paste the final 20 `PressureBinBand(lower=..., upper=...)` entries as a ready-to-copy Python dict literal for `PRESSURE_BIN_SCORE_NEUTRAL_ZONES` in `app/services/endgame_zones.py`. Mark any quintile promoted to per-(TC × ELO × quintile) with a note.
4. **Collapse verdict block** per axis (TC, ELO), one block per quintile.

### 3.4 Endgame Type Breakdown

Maps to the page H2 of the same name. Hosts `EndgameWDLChart` + `EndgameConvRecovChart`.

#### 3.4.1 Per-class score / conversion / recovery

**Question:** How do per-game score, conversion, and recovery vary across the 6 endgame classes (rook / minor_piece / pawn / queen / mixed / pawnless), and across (TC × ELO)?

**Multi-class semantics**: per `query_endgame_entry_rows`, each `(game, endgame_class)` span ≥6 plies contributes one row. A single game traversing queen→rook contributes once to each. This is the same convention as the live Endgame Categories tab.

**Bucketing**: per REFAC-02, conv/recov is determined by the Stockfish eval at the **first ply of each class span** (not at the game's first endgame ply). This matches `query_endgame_entry_rows`, which projects `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` per (game, endgame_class) span via `array_agg(... ORDER BY ply)[1]`. The classification rule is identical to 3.2.1: mate scores force conv/recov; otherwise cp vs ±`EVAL_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD = 100`; NULL routes to parity. There is no longer a 4-ply persistence join — the old material-imbalance proxy is gone.

##### Per-user per-class score distribution (for Score bullet neutral-zone calibration)

In addition to the cell-level query above, run a second pass that computes per-user-per-class chess-score and reports the IQR per class. This calibrates the per-class neutral zones for the per-card Score bullet redesigned in Phase 87 (single chess-score bullet replacing the legacy Conv+Recov peer bullets — `EndgameTypeCard.tsx` reference). Without per-class IQR the bullets fall back to the global `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX = 0.45/0.55` from `scoreBulletConfig.ts`, which the 3.4.1 pooled-by-class data already shows is approximately right (all classes within ±0.5pp of 50%) — but the IQR tells us whether the global band is also the right width per class.

##### Output

For each of the three metrics (score / conversion / recovery):

1. **One sub-table per endgame class** (6 sub-tables): rows = ELO bucket (5), columns = TC (4). Cell = `metric (n)`. Suppress per sample-floor (n_games < 100 for score; n_conv < 30 for conv; n_recov < 30 for recov).
2. **Pooled-by-class summary** (collapses ELO and TC): one row per class with pooled `score / score_diff / conversion / recovery` and sample sizes.
3. **Per-class chess-score IQR table** (new — from the per-user query above): columns `endgame_class | n_users | mean | p10 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p90`. This is the row most likely to drive the Score-bullet neutral-zone calibration in `EndgameTypeCard.tsx`.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - **Per-class Score-bullet neutral zone** (currently global `SCORE_BULLET_NEUTRAL_MIN/MAX = 0.45/0.55` in `frontend/src/lib/scoreBulletConfig.ts`, applied to every per-class card):
     - Compare per-class p25 / p75 against the global `[0.45, 0.55]` band.
     - If a class's `[p25, p75]` shifts the midpoint by > 1pp from 0.50 OR widens / narrows by > 2pp, propose a per-class override. Suggested per-class shape mirrors `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES`: a new `PER_CLASS_SCORE_BULLET_ZONES: Record<EndgameClass, { neutralMin: number; neutralMax: number }>` in `endgame_zones.py`, codegen'd to TS via `scripts/gen_endgame_zones_ts.py`, consumed in `EndgameTypeCard.tsx` via a lookup analogous to `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[class]`.
     - If all classes stay within `[0.495, 0.505]` midpoint and `± 1pp` width vs the global band, keep the global band and document the verdict.
   - **Per-class score-diff neutral zone** (legacy `NEUTRAL_ZONE_MIN/MAX = ±0.05` in the now-deleted `EndgameWDLChart.tsx`): DEPRECATED after Phase 87 — the score-diff bullet was removed in the redesign and replaced with an absolute chess-score bullet vs the 50% baseline. Score-diff zone is no longer used by any live UI surface.
   - **Per-class conv/recov gauge zones** (`PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES` in `endgame_zones.py`): already per-class as of 2026-05-01. Compare current values against fresh pooled rates — recommend a delta only when the pooled rate drifts more than ~3pp from the live midpoint.
5. **Collapse verdict per (metric × class)**: 6 classes × 3 metrics = 18 verdicts. For each metric × class, run Cohen's d across {TC, ELO} marginals on the per-cell pooled rate (n ≥ 30 cell-floor). This is rate-level rather than per-user because per-user-per-class would be too sparse at the current sample size.

If 18 verdicts is too noisy, aggregate to one verdict per metric (across-class max d) plus per-class footnote when an outlier class fails the metric-level verdict.

#### 3.4.2 Per-span Score Gap by Endgame Type (Phase 87.1 SEED-016)

**Question:** How does `per_span_achievable_score_gap_by_class = mean(gap_span)` distribute per user per endgame class, and does it shift across (TC × ELO) cells? Calibrates `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[cls].achievable_score_gap` bands and the global `ZONE_REGISTRY["endgame_type_achievable_score_gap"]` ZoneSpec.

**User-facing terminology** (per CONTEXT.md D-02, amended 2026-05-15):
- Concepts / glossary label: **"Endgame Type Score Gap"** (full qualifier — disambiguates from page-level "Endgame Score Gap" and "Achievable Score Gap").
- Card row label: **"Score Gap"** (short form — card title supplies endgame type context).
- Internal identifier (code, registry, schema fields, this calibration metric): `endgame_type_achievable_score_gap` / `per_span_achievable_score_gap_by_class`. Preserves grep with the page-level `achievable_score_gap` math family (Phase 85.1).

**Per-user metric (per class):**
- One row per qualifying span: `(game_id, endgame_class)` with ≥6 plies (same gate as 3.4.1).
- `ES_entry = eval_cp_to_expected_score(entry_eval_cp, user_color)` (Lichess winning-chances sigmoid; `_signed_pawns_from_mate` saturates mate scores). Computed from the span's first ply.
- `exit_score`:
  - **Transitory span** (followed by another span in the same game): `ES_sigmoid(next_entry_eval_cp, user_color)` via `LEAD()` window over `(game_id ORDER BY span_min_ply ASC)`.
  - **Terminal span** (last span in the game): game result mapped via `user_color` → `{win: 1.0, draw: 0.5, loss: 0.0}`.
- `gap_span = exit_score − ES_entry` (sign convention per CONTEXT D-07: positive = user outperformed the Stockfish baseline across this span).
- Spans with both `entry_eval_cp IS NULL AND entry_eval_mate IS NULL` are excluded from the cohort (non-issue in practice — ≥6-ply prod eval coverage is ~100%).
- `per_span_achievable_score_gap_by_class = mean(gap_span)` per user per class.

**Sample floor:** ≥20 qualifying spans per user per class per cell (mirrors the §3.1.5 game floor; per-class cohorts are smaller, so the floor matches the per-class Conv/Recov n_games gate).

**Cohen's-d collapse verdict per axis (TC, ELO):** same 3-level pattern as §3.1.5 — `d < 0.2` collapse, `0.2 ≤ d < 0.5` review, `d ≥ 0.5` keep separate.

**Decision rule for updating zone bands** (per CONTEXT D-04):
- If both axes collapse on a given class: set `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[cls].achievable_score_gap` to the pooled [p25, p75] for that class. The 6 per-class entries may end up identical or near-identical; that is fine.
- If both axes collapse across **all 6 classes** and the pooled-by-class bands are near-identical (midpoint within ±1pp, width within ±2pp): keep only the global `ZONE_REGISTRY["endgame_type_achievable_score_gap"]` ZoneSpec and set every `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[cls].achievable_score_gap` to the same global band.
- If "keep separate" on ELO for any class: stratify per class (per-class bands diverge); this matches the editorial precedent from §3.1.5 (`feedback_zone_band_judgement.md` — tighten the band if small effects are meaningful).
- Per memory `feedback_llm_significance_signal.md`: do not add a separate sig-test signal to the LLM payload (Plan 04). Tighten the cohort band instead.

**Output instructions:**
1. Update `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[<class>].achievable_score_gap` in `app/services/endgame_zones.py` per the per-class calibrated band (or set all 6 entries to the same pooled band if collapse verdict justifies).
2. Optionally update `ZONE_REGISTRY["endgame_type_achievable_score_gap"]` (the global default surfaced to the LLM payload via `assign_zone`).
3. Run `uv run python scripts/gen_endgame_zones_ts.py` to regenerate `frontend/src/generated/endgameZones.ts`. CI gates drift via `git diff --exit-code` on the generated file.
4. Add the per-class IQR table and collapse verdict to `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md` under a new §3.4.2 block; archive the previous report per the "Report file layout" rotation rule below.

##### Output

For each class (6 sub-tables; `pawnless` is hidden in the UI per `HIDDEN_ENDGAME_CLASSES` but the bench output keeps it for completeness):

1. **5×4 cell table** (rows = ELO bucket, columns = TC). Cell = `p50 (n_users)`. Suppress where `n_users < 20`. Sparse-cell exclusion `(2400, classical)` applies per the universal report-header rule.
2. **Pooled-by-class IQR row**: `endgame_class | n_users | mean | p25 | p50 | p75`. Drives the per-class band proposal.
3. **Cohen's-d collapse verdicts**: per class × {TC, ELO}, computed against the per-cell pooled `mean_gap`. 6 × 2 = 12 verdicts; aggregate to one verdict per axis (across-class max d) when reporting.
4. **Per-class band proposal**: `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[cls].achievable_score_gap = (p25, p75)`. Compare against the placeholder `(-0.05, 0.05)` shipped in this plan (Phase 87.1 Plan 01) — recommend a delta only when |p25 - placeholder_lower| > 0.5pp or |p75 - placeholder_upper| > 0.5pp.
5. **Global band proposal**: pooled-across-classes [p25, p75] for `ZONE_REGISTRY["endgame_type_achievable_score_gap"]`. If all 6 classes collapse together, recommend setting this band and identical per-class entries.

**Calibration caveat (mandatory in popover copy and prompt-version bump, but recorded here for the methodology audit):** The Lichess winning-chances sigmoid under-weights endgame eval advantages (~`feedback`: `lichess-sigmoid-endgame-calibration.md`). Per-class IQR-derived zones absorb the bias so zone placement is calibrated even though absolute gap magnitudes are scale-compressed.

**Scope note:** Running the benchmark query is OUT OF SCOPE for the Phase 87.1 Plan 01 ROADMAP gate — this subchapter documents the method so a future calibration run can produce real per-class bands. The placeholder bands from `endgame_zones.py` remain in effect until then.

#### 3.4.3 Endgame Type Score vs Score Gap — agreement / redundancy analysis

**Question:** On each Endgame Type card the UI currently renders **five** signals — Conversion + Recovery gauges, Score Gap bullet (3.4.2), WDL bar, and Endgame Score bullet (3.4.1). Score and Score Gap are mathematically related (both derive from game outcome) but Score Gap also subtracts the Stockfish expected score at span entry. Are the two bullets redundant enough on real cohorts to justify dropping one?

This subchapter is the **decision input for "drop Endgame Score bullet" vs "drop WDL bar" vs "keep all three"** on the per-type cards (`EndgameTypeCard.tsx`).

**Per-user joined metric (per class):**
- Reuses the §3.4.1 per-user-per-class chess-score CTE (≥10 games gate) and the §3.4.2 per-user-per-class mean Score Gap CTE (≥20 qualifying spans gate). Equal-footing filter (`abs(opp_rating - user_rating) <= 100`) applied to both as usual.
- Inner-join on `(user_id, game-time elo_bucket, tc_bucket, endgame_class)` — a user contributes to the analysis only when both metrics clear their respective floors for that class, paired within the same game-time ELO bucket. Drop-out users are reported separately (informative — tells us how often one metric is available but the other isn't).
- Per-user pair: `(score, mean_gap)` per (cell × class).

**Comparisons computed per class** (pooled across the 4×5 cell grid, sparse-cell exclusion `(2400, classical)` applied):

1. **Pearson r** between `score` and `mean_gap`. High r (>0.85) means the two metrics rank users almost identically — the bullet rows visually carry the same information.
2. **Sign-agreement rate**: fraction of users where `sign(score − score_neutral_mid)` matches `sign(mean_gap − gap_neutral_mid)`. Score neutral mid = 0.50; Gap neutral mid = 0.0 (engine-alignment null).
3. **Zone-agreement matrix (3×3)**: classify each user into `{red, neutral, green}` on each axis using **per-class IQR-derived bands** computed from the cohort itself: red = `metric < p25_class`, green = `metric > p75_class`, neutral otherwise. Both bands are computed per class per metric (so a user is "red on rook score" if they're below the rook-cohort's p25 score). This avoids the dependence on placeholder zones in `endgame_zones.py` / `scoreBulletConfig.ts` and tests redundancy at the *visual classification* layer the UI would adopt if it switched to IQR-calibrated bands. Report the 9-cell matrix as fractions. Diagonal sum = strict agreement; off-diagonal corners (red↔green) = strong disagreement.
4. **Strong-disagreement rate**: fraction of users in opposite extreme zones (one green, the other red). The headline number for the redundancy decision.
5. **Effect-size ratio**: `stdev(metric) / (cohort IQR half-width)` for each metric. Under IQR-derived bands this is the **interquartile dispersion ratio**: ≈ 1.0 is the by-construction value for a near-symmetric unimodal distribution; values much above 1.0 signal heavy tails (the gauge will routinely paint extreme outside the IQR domain even when the user is statistically typical). Computed per class.

*Note on "lights-up" rate:* under IQR-derived bands, both `score_lights_up` and `gap_lights_up` equal 50% by construction (25% red + 25% green). The column is mechanically uninformative under this design and is omitted; discriminating-power comparison shifts to the `stdev` and `effect-size ratio` columns instead.

*Note on independence baselines* (per metric, marginally 25/50/25 across red/neutral/green):

- **Strict zone-agreement under independence** (r=0): `0.25² + 0.50² + 0.25² = 37.5%`.
- **Strong disagreement under independence** (r=0): `2 × 0.25² = 12.5%`.
- **Strict zone-agreement under perfect collinearity** (r=1): 100% (zone agreement matches sign agreement exactly).
- **Strong disagreement under perfect collinearity** (r=1): 0%.

These set the floor/ceiling for the rubric thresholds below — a strict-agreement of 50% under IQR-zones is *not* the same signal as 50% under fixed bands; it's only ~12.5pp above the independence baseline of 37.5%.

**Decision rubric** (apply per class, then aggregate; IQR-zone calibrated):

| r | Zone strict-agreement | Strong-disagreement | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| > 0.85 | > 75% | < 5% | **Drop Endgame Score bullet.** Score Gap dominates: captures everything Score does plus position-difficulty adjustment; the two bullets carry near-identical rankings. Keep WDL as the glanceable anchor. |
| 0.60–0.85 | 55–75% | 5–10% | **Drop WDL bar.** Score and Score Gap carry meaningfully different information; preserve both bullets. Card already has Conv+Recov gauges as the visual anchor, so WDL becomes the redundant one. |
| < 0.60 | < 55% | > 10% | **Keep all three.** Score, Score Gap, and WDL are reading different things; cognitive load cost is justified. Revisit whether Conv+Recov gauges can be made smaller instead. |

If classes disagree on the rubric verdict (e.g. rook says "drop Score" but minor_piece says "drop WDL"), report the per-class split and treat the **mode across the 5 visible classes** as the recommendation — `EndgameTypeCard.tsx` renders the same chart set per class, no per-class branching.

**Sample floor:** ≥30 users per class after the inner join (Pearson r with n<30 is too noisy for a 3-way decision). Suppress per-cell sub-breakdowns; this subchapter is intentionally pooled-by-class because the question is "are these signals redundant *on the card*", which is a population-level question, not a cell-stratified one.

##### Output

For the §3.4.3 block in `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md`:

1. **Per-class summary table** (5 rows — `pawnless` hidden):

   | endgame_class | n_users | pearson_r | sign_agreement | zone_strict_agreement | strong_disagreement | score_stdev | gap_stdev |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

   The `score_lights_up` / `gap_lights_up` columns are dropped (mechanically 50% under IQR zones).

2. **Pooled-across-classes row** appended to the same table.

3. **Per-class IQR band table** (5 rows): `class | score_p25 | score_p75 | gap_p25 | gap_p75`. Documents the actual band edges used for zone classification so the analysis is reproducible without re-running the SQL.

4. **Per-class 3×3 zone-agreement matrices** (5 small tables, rows = score_zone, cols = gap_zone, cells = fraction).

5. **Drop-out report**: for each class, count users present in §3.4.1 only, in §3.4.2 only, and in both. Indicates how often a card would show one bullet but not the other if floors were re-aligned.

6. **Effect-size ratio table** (per class): `score_stdev / ((score_p75 − score_p25) / 2)` and `gap_stdev / ((gap_p75 − gap_p25) / 2)`. Under IQR-derived bands this is the interquartile dispersion ratio — values much above 1.0 signal heavy tails.

7. **Verdict per class** using the decision rubric table above, plus the **mode verdict** as the headline recommendation. Surface this verdict in the "Recommended thresholds summary" table at the bottom of the report as an action on `EndgameTypeCard.tsx` chart inventory (no code constant — it's a layout decision, not a threshold).

**Note on IQR-derived zones:** zone bands are self-derived from the cohort, so the analysis is independent of any placeholder in `endgame_zones.py` / `scoreBulletConfig.ts`. If §3.4.2 later calibrates `PER_CLASS_GAUGE_ZONES[cls].achievable_score_gap` to the same IQR edges this query produces, the live zone classification will match this benchmark's classification exactly. If the live bands deviate (e.g. tightened editorially), strict-agreement and strong-disagreement in the live UI will differ from this benchmark; Pearson r and sign-agreement remain band-independent and stable across regimes.

**Scope note:** This subchapter exists to inform the chart-inventory decision on `EndgameTypeCard.tsx` raised during /gsd-explore on 2026-05-15. It does not calibrate any code constants directly.

## 4. Global Percentile CDF

> **Correspondence with the production CDF changed in Phase 94.2 (see top-of-file callout).** This chapter describes the **per-cohort empirical CDF methodology** that produced the Phase 93 v1 `GLOBAL_PERCENTILE_CDF` artifact: one per-(user, game-time elo_bucket, tc) value pooled across the sparse-excluded (TC × ELO) grid. **As of Phase 94.2, the production CDF in `app/services/global_percentile_cdf.py` is no longer this distribution** — Plan 02 of 94.2 regenerated it under pooled-per-user methodology (recent 1000/TC across all played TCs, 36-month window, single ≥30 floor on the pooled set, one row per user; see `app/services/canonical_slice_sql.py` for the authoritative builders and `.planning/phases/94.2-pooled-per-user-percentile-redesign/` for the rationale). The numbers in `scripts/gen_global_percentile_cdf.py` were regenerated then too, so the breakpoint array on this chapter's SQL no longer matches the committed `GLOBAL_PERCENTILE_CDF` array. The per-cohort, per-rating-bucket sanity-check methodology below remains a **valid analytical breakdown** (same role as `_build_per_bucket_sanity_query` after 94.2 Plan 02) — it is just no longer the production-chip distribution. When this chapter mentions "the chip" / "Phase 94 backend interpolation" / "the committed artifact" / "GLOBAL_PERCENTILE_CDF", treat those references as **historical** to Phase 93 v1 and consult `app/services/canonical_slice_sql.py` for current production behaviour.

This chapter produces per-metric empirical CDFs (cumulative distribution functions) over the four chipped ΔES metrics, **globally pooled** across the (TC × ELO) grid. The committed artifact lives at `app/services/global_percentile_cdf.py` (a sibling of `app/services/endgame_zones.py`, NOT a graft into it — the CDF tables have a different artifact shape than ZoneSpec). Mechanization is `scripts/gen_global_percentile_cdf.py` (Plan 02 — DB → Python regen is a manual recalibration step, mirroring `scripts/backfill_eval.py --db benchmark`; no CI gate, no auto-regen). The report deliverable is `reports/percentile/global-percentile-cdf-latest.md`, with the same rotation rule as `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md` (see §"Report file layout").

The downstream consumer is **Phase 94 backend only**: it interpolates the user's per-metric value against `GLOBAL_PERCENTILE_CDF` at request time and emits a scalar `{metric}_percentile` field on the endgame response schemas, which the chip + popover render from. Phase 93 ships **no client-side code, no TS mirror, no Python→TS codegen, no CI drift-guard** (D-01) — unlike `endgame_zones.py` whose IQR bands are painted client-side, the CDF output is a single scalar computed server-side. A future client-side viz (sparkline of the user's position on the global distribution, "what value puts me in the top X%" widget, offline what-if calculator) is the trigger to add a TS mirror; it is not pre-built here.

**Out of scope (explicit — D-02 rationale):**
- **Recovery Score Gap percentiles** (`section2_score_gap_recov`) — opponent-confounded with Cohen's d ≈ 0.95 inverted rating coupling per `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-gap-metrics-percentile-candidacy.md` (2026-05-22). Defer until Recovery is repaired or re-framed.
- **Raw % gauge percentiles** (Conversion / Parity / Recovery rate gauges — `conversion_win_pct`, `parity_score_pct`, `recovery_save_pct`) — redundant chips on cards whose ΔES row is already chipped.
- **Per-(TC, ELO)-cell CDFs** — SEED-019 deliberately ships global-only comparison. The bragging-rights "top X% of all players" framing is the explicit product call; per-cell CDFs are not in v1.19 scope.
- **Tier-4 per-endgame-class CDFs** — per-class samples too thin (~8 rook conversion spans per user is noise); deferred per `REQUIREMENTS.md` §Future Requirements.
- **Opening insights percentile annotations** — candidate for a future Opening Insights v2 milestone.
- **TS mirror / client-side codegen / Python→TS drift-guard** — D-01; add when a client-side CDF consumer ships.

### In-scope metrics

The artifact ships exactly **4** `MetricId` literals from `app/schemas/endgames.py` (no new IDs introduced — D-03):

- **`score_gap`** — page-level Endgame Score Gap (`eg_score − non_eg_score`); see §3.1.6. Per-user inclusion floor: **≥30 endgame AND ≥30 non-endgame games** per user in their selected TC (matches the §3.1.6 cohort-band floor).
- **`achievable_score_gap`** — page-level Achievable Score Gap (paired per-game `actual − expected` against the Stockfish-baseline expected score); see §3.1.5. Per-user inclusion floor: **≥20 endgame-entry games** per user with a paired (actual, expected) score (matches the §3.1.5 floor).
- **`section2_score_gap_parity`** — Section 2 Parity ΔES Score Gap (per-span `exit_score − ES_entry`, partitioned to spans whose entry-eval bucket is `parity`); see §3.2.2. Per-user inclusion floor: **≥20 qualifying spans per user in the parity bucket** (matches the §3.2.2 span floor).
- **`section2_score_gap_conv`** — Section 2 Conversion ΔES Score Gap (per-span `exit_score − ES_entry`, partitioned to spans whose entry-eval bucket is `conversion`); see §3.2.2. Per-user inclusion floor: **≥20 qualifying spans per user in the conversion bucket** (matches the §3.2.2 span floor).

Per-metric floors are kept from the pre-flight (rather than unified) to preserve continuity with `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-gap-metrics-percentile-candidacy.md` (Claude's Discretion item #2 from CONTEXT.md).

### Canonical CTE — inherited verbatim from §1

The CDF query uses the Chapter 1 building blocks unchanged — **do not duplicate the SQL here** (the authoritative SQL lives in `scripts/gen_global_percentile_cdf.py`; the illustrative snippet at the end of this chapter is a composition example, not a substitute):

- **Standard CTE — `selected_users`** (§1) — `benchmark_selected_users ⋈ benchmark_ingest_checkpoints` on `lichess_username + tc_bucket` with `bic.status = 'completed'`, joined to `users` on `lower(lichess_username)`. Bypassing the canonical CTE produces a wrong global distribution and therefore wrong percentiles for every user; the CDF tails are more sensitive to CTE drift than the IQR zone bands are (D-05).
- **Sparse-cell exclusion** (§1) — `(elo_bucket = 2400 AND tc_bucket = 'classical')` is dropped from the pooled distribution (n=12 completed users, ~55 games/user, pool exhausted). Same rule applied to TC marginals, ELO marginals, and Cohen's d throughout Chapters 2–3.
- **Equal-footing opponent filter** (§1) — `abs(opp_rating − user_rating) ≤ 100` (both ratings `NOT NULL`). Universal across every per-metric subchapter as of 2026-05-03; the CDF inherits it so the global distribution represents skill at equal footing, not skill at typical Lichess matchmaking.
- **Rating-lag selection bias — game-time ELO bucketing** (§1, "Rating-lag selection bias (game-time bucketing)" and "user_elo_at_game / elo_bucket" in Shared SQL building blocks) — every per-user row is bucketed by the cohort user's **rating at game time** (`games.white_rating` / `games.black_rating`), NOT by `benchmark_selected_users.rating_bucket`. Sub-800 rows are dropped (`elo_bucket IS NULL`). A single user spans 2–3 game-time ELO buckets across their career; per-user metric values are computed per `(user_id, elo_bucket, tc)`.

The pooled distribution is **global** (pooled across all `(elo_bucket, tc_bucket)` cells except the sparse `(2400, classical)` cell) — not per-cell. The chip phrasing "top X% of all players" requires a single global CDF, not per-(TC, ELO) CDFs. The per-rating-bucket tables in the next subsection are sanity checks on the pooled distribution, not separate CDFs.

### Breakpoint set

The locked breakpoint set is **every integer percentile from p1 through p99** — 99 breakpoints total (`p1, p2, p3, ..., p97, p98, p99`), no sub-percent steps. Per `ROADMAP.md` Phase 93 success criterion #5.

**Rationale for the bounded tails (p1/p99, NOT extreme-tail extensions):** at the current pooled cohort size (n ≈ 2000 across the 4 metrics) the deep-tail breakpoints have approximately ±5pp sampling SE and would swing on single outliers — the bounded p1..p99 range deliberately keeps such extreme-tail breakpoints **out of scope**. Tighter tails are a future ops task — cohort re-selection at a higher `--per-cell` from `scripts/select_benchmark_users.py` — deferred until that cohort exists.

**Rationale for integer-only steps (no sub-percent intermediates):** chip-rendered phrasing operates on whole-percent precision ("top 3%", not "top 2.5%"). Half-percent shoulders are **out of scope** because they would be stored but never rendered.

**Chip phrasing convention:** all chip copy uses the **"top X%"** form (NEVER "bottom X%"). A user at p3 renders as "top 97%"; a user at p97 renders as "top 3%". The CDF table stores the empirical percentile; the renderer (Phase 94) converts to the top-X% framing.

> **Superseded breakpoint sets** (earlier drafts, kept here for audit trail only — do not implement): an earlier 19-breakpoint *tail-densified* set (including p0.1, p0.5, p99.5, p99.9 and the `p2.5 / p97.5` half-percent shoulders) was proposed in `SEED-019` and an intermediate 15-breakpoint p1..p99-with-half-steps draft followed in CONTEXT.md D-06. Both are out of scope as of 2026-05-22 (CONTEXT.md D-06 revised to match ROADMAP success criterion #5); any incidental mention of `p0.1` / `p99.9` / `p2.5` / `p97.5` / `p0.5` / `p99.5` should appear only inside this superseded / out-of-scope footnote or an earlier-draft callout.

### Per-rating-bucket sanity-check methodology

For each of the 4 metrics, the report includes a per-rating-bucket table showing:

| rating bucket | n_users | median | skew | kurtosis |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 800 (game-time) | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 1200 (game-time) | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 1600 (game-time) | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2000 (game-time) | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2400 (game-time) | ... | ... | ... | ... |

This mirrors `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-gap-metrics-percentile-candidacy.md` (2026-05-22). Purpose: verify that the pooled distribution behaves reasonably across rating strata. Conversion ΔES is known to have skew ≈ −0.95 and excess kurtosis ≈ +1.42 per the pre-flight (sigmoid-asymmetry artifact, ceiling at 1.0); sanity-check tables document this is expected, not a data bug. The sparse `(2400, classical)` cell is excluded from these marginals per §1 rules.

Rating buckets follow the §1 canonical anchors `800 / 1200 / 1600 / 2000 / 2400` (game-time, 400-wide, sub-800 dropped).

### Expected report shape

`reports/percentile/global-percentile-cdf-latest.md` MUST contain, at minimum (slim format — Claude's Discretion item #3):

1. **Header block** — DB provenance (benchmark, localhost:5433, flawchess_benchmark), snapshot ISO timestamp, `BENCHMARK_DB_SNAPSHOT_MONTH` (currently `"2026-03"`), per-metric n_users, the canonical-CTE inheritance note, and the same sparse-cell + equal-footing + game-time-bucketing methodology notes as `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md`.
2. **Per-metric breakpoint table** — 99 rows × value columns: percentile label (`p1, p2, ..., p99`) and value at that percentile. Values rendered in pp with one decimal (`−2.3pp`) per the §1 Display formatting rule (`max(|p25|, |p75|)` family). The CDF stores raw 0–1 score-difference values internally; the report renders them in pp.
3. **Per-metric per-rating-bucket sanity-check table** — 5 rows × 4 columns (`n_users / median / skew / kurtosis`) as shown above. One table per metric. Sparse `(2400, classical)` excluded.
4. **Per-metric n_users header line** — explicit cohort size after the per-user inclusion floor is applied, so the reader can verify the cohort matches the pre-flight expectations (~2000 users per metric ±200 depending on per-metric floors).

The slim format is sufficient for `ROADMAP.md` Phase 93 success criterion #3. The richer pre-flight-style layout (full per-bucket distribution percentiles + per-axis ELO collapse verdicts) is not required — those live in `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md` already and are not re-derived here.

### Mechanization & rotation rule

Methodology is mechanized by `scripts/gen_global_percentile_cdf.py` (Plan 02). The script:

- Reuses the `--db benchmark` safety guard pattern from `scripts/backfill_eval.py`: refuses to run unless `DATABASE_URL` contains both `flawchess_benchmark` AND `:5433`, preventing accidental writes against dev/prod.
- Runs the canonical CTE (§1) per metric, projects the 99 integer percentiles via `percentile_cont(ARRAY[0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99]) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <metric>)`, and emits the result as committed Python source at `app/services/global_percentile_cdf.py` (typed `Mapping[MetricId, CdfTable]` registry, dataclass shape mirroring `endgame_zones.ZONE_REGISTRY` — Claude's Discretion item #4).
- Embeds two audit-trail constants in the committed Python source (Claude's Discretion item #4): `BENCHMARK_DB_SNAPSHOT_MONTH = "2026-03"` (str) and a per-metric `n_users: int` field on each `CdfTable`. Both also appear in the report header so a future recalibration session can verify what cohort the live chips were trained against.
- DB → Python regen is a **manual recalibration step**. Re-run on demand (new benchmark snapshot month, metric floor change, methodology fix). No CI gate, no auto-regen, no scheduled job.

**Report rotation rule (D-07).** On each run:
1. If `reports/percentile/global-percentile-cdf-latest.md` exists, read the date from its first-line header (`# FlawChess Global Percentile CDF — YYYY-MM-DD`).
2. Rename it to `reports/percentile/global-percentile-cdf-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. If that dated archive already exists, leave the archive alone and overwrite `reports/percentile/global-percentile-cdf-latest.md` in place (same convention as `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md`).
3. Write the new snapshot to `reports/percentile/global-percentile-cdf-latest.md`.

Never mutate an existing dated archive.

### Illustrative SQL snippet (composition example — not authoritative)

The authoritative SQL is in `scripts/gen_global_percentile_cdf.py`. The snippet below illustrates how the 99-breakpoint `percentile_cont` composes onto the canonical CTE for a single metric (`achievable_score_gap`); the script generalizes this across all 4 in-scope metrics with their per-metric floors:

```sql
WITH selected_users AS (
  -- §1 Standard CTE — selected_users (status='completed', sub-800 dropped via game-time bucketing below)

      0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.20,

      0.41, 0.42, 0.43, 0.44, 0.45, 0.46, 0.47, 0.48, 0.49, 0.50,

      0.61, 0.62, 0.63, 0.64, 0.65, 0.66, 0.67, 0.68, 0.69, 0.70,

    ]::double precision[]
  ) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY achievable_gap) AS breakpoints,
  count(*) AS n_users
FROM per_user_excl_sparse;
```

The 99-element `breakpoints` array is the row that lands in `GLOBAL_PERCENTILE_CDF["achievable_score_gap"].values` (with index `i ∈ {0..98}` mapping to percentile `i + 1`). Phase 94's interpolation helper consumes this array plus `n_users`.

## Report file layout

Write to `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md`. Before writing, if that file already exists, read the date from its first line (`# FlawChess Benchmarks — YYYY-MM-DD`) and rename it to `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Don't overwrite an existing dated archive — if `benchmarks-YYYY-MM-DD.md` already exists for that date, leave the archive alone and overwrite `benchmarks-latest.md` in place. Layout:

```markdown
# FlawChess Benchmarks — <DATE>

- **DB**: benchmark (Docker on localhost:5433, flawchess_benchmark)
- **Snapshot taken**: <ISO timestamp>
- **Population**: <N_users> users / <N_games> games / <N_positions> positions
- **Cell anchoring**: 400-wide ELO buckets via the cohort user's **rating at game time** (`games.white_rating`/`games.black_rating`, sub-800 dropped) — NOT `benchmark_selected_users.rating_bucket`; tc_bucket from `benchmark_selected_users`; per-user TC restricted to selected tc_bucket. State the **"Methodology change (2026-05-19): rating-at-game-time bucketing"** note in the report header.
- **Selection provenance**: 2026-03 Lichess monthly dump, 9133 selected users, <N_ingested> ingested at ~50/cell
- **Per-user history caveat**: each user contributes up to 1000 games per TC over a 36-month window at varying ratings, so a user spans 2–3 game-time ELO buckets; "ELO bucket effect" is now a genuine rating-at-game-time effect. `benchmark_selected_users.rating_bucket` / `median_elo` are retained as longitudinal/trajectory columns only. Any whole-career per-user scalar (e.g. composite Endgame Skill) is now per-bucket/trajectory, not one number — flag for the live-UI comparator.
- **Base filters**: g.rated AND NOT g.is_computer_game; per-user filter g.time_control_bucket = bsu.tc_bucket; benchmark_ingest_checkpoints.status = 'completed' (mandatory canonical-CTE filter)
- **Equal-footing filter (universal — all subchapters)**: `abs(opp_rating - user_rating) <= 100`. Applied to every per-game CTE in Chapters 2 and 3 to remove the matchmaking confound. Live UI uses unfiltered games — the gap above the equal-footing baseline is the intended skill signal. Scope changed to universal on 2026-05-03; pre-2026-05-03 score-gap / clock / time-pressure numbers are not directly comparable. If a non-sparse cell drops below sample floor after filtering, escalate by re-selecting/re-ingesting more users/games rather than relaxing the filter. See `.planning/notes/benchmark-equal-footing-framing.md` for rationale.
- **Conv/Parity/Recovery bucketing**: Stockfish eval at the first endgame ply (or first ply of each class span in 3.4.1). Mirrors `_classify_endgame_bucket` (`EVAL_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD = 100` cp; mate scores force conv/recov; NULL → parity). REFAC-02 — the old `material_imbalance + 4-ply persistence` proxy is gone; 3.1.2 / 3.1.3 / 3.2.1 / 3.4.1 read `eval_cp` / `eval_mate` directly.
- **Eval coverage**: <pct>% of qualifying endgame entries have non-NULL eval (`eval_cp IS NOT NULL OR eval_mate IS NOT NULL`). Expected ~100% on the benchmark DB after the Stockfish backfill — flag if < 99%.
- **Sparse-cell exclusion**: `(2400, classical)` is excluded from TC marginals, ELO marginals, pooled overall, and Cohen's d on both axes (n=12 completed users, ~55 games/user, pool exhausted). It is still shown in cell-level 5×4 tables with an `n=12*` footnote.
- **Verdict thresholds**: Cohen's d < 0.2 collapse / 0.2–0.5 review / ≥ 0.5 keep separate
- **Sample floors**: <floors used per subchapter>
- **Cell coverage** (status='completed' users per cell): <inline 5×4 table, sparse cell flagged>

## Recommended thresholds summary

| Metric | Subchapter | Code constant | Currently set | Recommended | Collapse verdict | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

One row per gauge constant. Recommended value comes from the pooled or per-cell distribution depending on the collapse verdict. Action is one of `keep` / `widen to X` / `narrow to Y` / `stratify per TC` / `stratify per ELO` / `stratify fully`.

## Re-running

If `reports/benchmark/benchmarks-latest.md` exists and the user asks for a subchapter subset, replace only those subchapters in place; preserve the header and the two final summary tables. Always rebuild the summary tables from whatever subchapters are present.

If the user asks for a fresh snapshot, follow the rotation rule in "Report file layout": archive the current `benchmarks-latest.md` to its dated filename (based on its first-line date), then write the new snapshot to `benchmarks-latest.md`. Never mutate an existing dated archive.
