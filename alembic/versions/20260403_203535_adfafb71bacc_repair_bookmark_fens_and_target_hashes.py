"""Repair bookmark and openings table FENs and target hashes.

Replays stored moves/PGN for every bookmark and opening to produce the correct
full FEN (with side-to-move, castling, en passant metadata) and recomputes
target_hash for bookmarks.

Board-only FENs (missing metadata) caused update_match_side to produce wrong
full_hash values because polyglot zobrist hashing includes side-to-move.
The openings table (source for bookmark suggestions) also stored board-only FENs,
so bookmarks created via Suggest inherited the wrong FEN.
