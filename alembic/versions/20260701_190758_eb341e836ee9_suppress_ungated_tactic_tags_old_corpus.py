"""suppress ungated tactic tags old corpus

Part A old-corpus data migration (D-03, D-04, SEED-074): the remote-submit path
(Phase 146) writes raw, ungated tactic tags whenever the forcing-line gate's PV
blob hasn't arrived yet, and those tags previously sat uncorrected until tier-4
backfill happened to reach that game. This migration delivers the "no ungated
tags anywhere" invariant immediately for the pre-existing corpus rather than
waiting on the tier-4 ES lottery to drain it (D-03 overrides SEED-074's
go-forward-only lean).

Suppresses (sets to NULL) `<orientation>_tactic_motif`/`_piece`/`_confidence`/
`_depth` ONLY for cp-based candidate rows, gated PER ORIENTATION on its own
blob column:
  - `<orientation>_pv_lines IS NULL` (blob truly absent, not the D-06 `[]`
    sentinel — an empty JSONB array is NOT NULL and never matches this
    predicate, so D-06 rows are preserved automatically)
  - joined `game_positions.eval_cp IS NOT NULL` (the cp-based gate applies;
    mate-adjacent rows have `eval_cp IS NULL` and are preserved)
  - `<orientation>_tactic_motif IS NOT NULL` (nothing to suppress otherwise)

`pre_flaw_eval_cp` is not a `game_flaws` column — it's
`game_positions[flaw_ply - 1].eval_cp` — so the predicate joins to
`game_positions` on `(user_id, game_id, ply = gf.ply - 1)`, which hits that
table's composite PK directly (index-driven, verified via EXPLAIN in
147-RESEARCH.md; no new index needed — the existing partial index
`ix_game_flaws_blob_backfill` on `game_flaws (game_id) WHERE
allowed_pv_lines IS NULL`, built for the tier-4 lottery, already drives the
candidate scan).

Batched via the repo's established `DO $$ ... WHILE rows_updated > 0 LOOP ...`
idiom (see the pawnless-reclassify migration), batch_size 100000. `game_flaws`
has no surrogate `id` column (composite PK `(user_id, game_id, ply)`), so
batching keys on that composite tuple via a `WITH batch AS (...) UPDATE ...
FROM batch` shape, not an `id IN (...)` pattern.

Idempotent: re-running the loop after the first pass updates zero rows, since
the target columns are already NULL and no longer match the WHERE predicate
(D-04's "idempotent + self-healing" requirement).
